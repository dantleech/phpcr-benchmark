Education in its general sense is a form of  learning in which  knowledge,  skills, and  habits of a group of people are transferred from one generation to the next through teaching, training, research, or simply through  autodidacticism. Generally, it occurs through any  experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts.
 Etymologically, the word &quot;education&quot; is derived from the Latin  ēducātiō (“A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing&quot;) from  ēdūcō (“I educate, I train”) which is related to the  homonym  ēdūcō (“I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect”) from  ē- (“from, out of”) and  dūcō (“I lead, I conduct”).
A right to education has been created and recognized by some jurisdictions: Since 1952, Article 2 of the first Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality. At the global level, the United Nations'  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 guarantees this right under its Article 13.
Throughout history various governments have made it illegal to educate children  privately or at home. Various  totalitarian regimes, for example, have mandated indoctrination through propaganda in the  Hitler Youth and  propaganda in education under various communist regimes.
Systems of schooling involve institutionalized teaching and learning in relation to a curriculum, which itself is established according to a predetermined purpose of the schools in the system. Schools systems are sometimes also based on religions, giving them different curricula.
In formal education, a  curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. As an idea, curriculum stems from the Latin word for  race course, referring to the course of  deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature  adults. A curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general  syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.
An  academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the  natural sciences, mathematics, computer science,  social sciences, humanities and  applied sciences.
Educational institutions may incorporate fine arts as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at colleges and universities as electives. The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.
The term preschool refers to a school for children who are not old enough to attend kindergarten. It is a nursery school.
Preschool education is important because it can give a child the edge in a competitive world and education climate. While children who do not receive the fundamentals during their preschool years will be taught the alphabet, counting, shapes and colors and designs when they begin their formal education they will be behind the children who already possess that  knowledge. The true purpose behind kindergarten is “to provide a child-centered, preschool curriculum for three to seven year old children that aimed at unfolding the child’s physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.”
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first 5–7 years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six or eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of primary-age children are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. Under the  Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory for children to receive primary education. The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate  middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools. Primary schools in these countries are often subdivided into  infant schools and  junior school.
In India, compulsory education spans over twelve years, out of which children receive elementary education for 8 years. Elementary schooling consists of five years of primary schooling and 3 years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on national curriculum framework designed by the  National Council of Educational Research and Training.
In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during  adolescence. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for  minors, to the optional, selective  tertiary, &quot;post-secondary&quot;, or &quot; higher&quot; education (e.g. university, vocational school) for  adults. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or  high schools,  gymnasiums,  lyceums, middle schools,  colleges, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada and Australia primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as  K-12 education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give  common knowledge, to prepare for  higher education or to train directly in a  profession.
The emergence of secondary education in the United States did not happen until 1910, caused by the rise in big businesses and technological advances in factories (for instance, the emergence of electrification), that required  skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand,  high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for  white collar or skilled  blue collar work. This proved to be beneficial for both employers and employees, for the improvement in human capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than employees with just primary educational attainment.
In Europe, grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of  public schools,  fee-paying schools, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves have an even longer history.
Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning that is related to but different from  informal learning. In a sense, autodidacticism is &quot;learning on your own&quot; or &quot;by yourself&quot;, and an autodidact is a self-teacher. Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorbing process. Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas.  Notable autodidacts include Abraham Lincoln (U.S. president),  Srinivasa Ramanujan (mathematician), Michael Faraday (chemist and physicist), Charles Darwin (naturalist), Thomas Alva Edison (inventor),  Tadao Ando (architect),  George Bernard Shaw (playwright),  Frank Zappa (composer, recording engineer, film director),and Leonardo da Vinci (engineer, scientist, mathematician).
 Vocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an  apprenticeship or  internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as  carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and  the arts.
 Indigenous education refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to “reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.”
An anarchistic free school (also anarchist free school and free school) is a decentralized network in which skills, information, and knowledge are shared without hierarchy or the institutional environment of formal schooling. Free school students may be adults, children, or both. This organisational structure is distinct from ones used by democratic free schools which permit children's individual initiatives and learning endeavors within the context of a school democracy, and from free education where 'traditional' schooling is made available to pupils without charge. The open structure of free schools is intended to encourage self-reliance, critical consciousness, and personal development. Free schools often operate outside the  market economy in favour of a  gift economy. Nevertheless, the meaning of the &quot;free&quot; of free schools is not restricted to monetary cost, and can refer to an emphasis on free speech and student-centred education.
 Alternative education, also known as non-traditional education or educational alternative, is a broad term that may be used to refer to all forms of education outside of  traditional education (for all age groups and levels of education). This may include not only forms of education designed for students with special needs (ranging from teenage pregnancy to intellectual disability), but also forms of education designed for a general audience and employing alternative educational philosophies and methods.
Alternatives of the latter type are often the result of  education reform and are rooted in various  philosophies that are commonly fundamentally different from those of traditional  compulsory education. While some have strong political,  scholarly, or philosophical orientations, others are more informal associations of teachers and  students dissatisfied with certain aspects of  traditional education. These alternatives, which include  charter schools,  alternative schools,  independent schools,  homeschooling and  autodidacticism vary, but often emphasize the value of small class size, close relationships between students and teachers, and a  sense of community.
Alternative education may also allow for independent learning and engaging class activities.
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were often educated by physicians or special tutors. These early physicians (people like  Itard,  Seguin,  Howe,  Gallaudet) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills. Special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities in its early years, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.
The concept of education through recreation was first applied to childhood development in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. Educationalist Lawrence  L.P. Jacks, who was also an early proponent of lifelong learning, best described the modern concept of education through recreation in the following quotation &quot;A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.&quot;(Jacks, 1932). Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities. The concept has been revived by the  University of Western Ontario to teach anatomy to medical students.
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high school or  secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include  undergraduate and  postgraduate education, as well as  vocational education and training. Colleges and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary education generally results in the receipt of  certificates,  diplomas, or  academic degrees.
Higher education generally involves work towards a degree-level or  foundation degree qualification. In most developed countries a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national  economies, both as a significant industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.
University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as  tertiary education) and the  graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as  graduate school). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent, like  Yale University, they can be public and State governed, like the  Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, or they can be independent but State funded, like the  University of Virginia.
Higher education in particular is currently undergoing a transition towards  open education,  elearning alone is currently growing at 14x the rate of traditional learning. Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as it's superior efficiency and results compared to traditionalist methods. Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today. Open education is generally significantly cheaper than traditional campus based learning and in many cases even free. Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form  edX Other universities offering open education are Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington, Caltech. It has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press. Many people despite favorable studies on effectivness may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.
The conventional merit system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities. Although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the Open University in the United Kingdom. Currently many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal &quot; academic value&quot; to traditional degrees. Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.
There has been a culture forming around distance learning for people who are looking to enjoy the shared social aspects that many people value in traditional on campus education that is not often directly offered from open education. Examples of this are people in open education forming  study groups,  meetups and movements such as  UnCollege.
A  liberal arts institution can be defined as a &quot; college or university  curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional,  vocational, or technical curriculum.&quot; Although what is known today as the liberal arts college began in Europe, the term is more commonly associated with Universities in the United States.
A nonresidential junior college offering courses to people living in a particular area.
One of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Also technology is an increasingly influential factor in education. Computers and mobile phones are used in developed countries both to complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as  online education (a type of  distance education). This gives students the opportunity to choose what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means the increase of programming and blogging. Technology offers powerful learning tools that demand new skills and understandings of students, including  Multimedia, and provides new ways to engage students, such as  Virtual learning environments. One such tool are  virtual manipulatives, which are an &quot;interactive, Web-based visual representation of a dynamic object that presents opportunities for constructing mathematical knowledge&quot; (Moyer, Bolyard, &amp; Spikell, 2002). In short, virtual manipulatives are dynamic visual/pictorial replicas of physical mathematical manipulatives, which have long been used to demonstrate and teach various mathematical concepts. Virtual manipulatives can be easily accessed on the Internet as stand-alone applets, allowing for easy access and use in a variety of educational settings. Emerging research into the effectiveness of virtual manipulatives as a teaching tool have yielded promising results, suggesting comparable, and in many cases superior overall concept-teaching effectiveness compared to standard teaching methods. Technology is being used more not only in administrative duties in education but also in the instruction of students. The use of technologies such as  PowerPoint and  interactive whiteboard is capturing the attention of students in the classroom. Technology is also being used in the assessment of students. One example is the  Audience Response System (ARS), which allows immediate feedback tests and classroom discussions.
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a “diverse set of tools and resources used to communicate, create, disseminate, store, and manage information.” These technologies include computers, the Internet, broadcasting technologies (radio and television), and telephony. There is increasing interest in how computers and the Internet can improve education at all levels, in both formal and non-formal settings. Older ICT technologies, such as radio and television, have for over forty years been used for open and distance learning, although print remains the cheapest, most accessible and therefore most dominant delivery mechanism in both developed and developing countries. In addition to classroom application and growth of e-learning opportunities for knowledge attainment, educators involved in student affairs programming have recognized the increasing importance of computer usage with data generation for and about students. Motivation and retention counselors, along with faculty and administrators, can impact the potential academic success of students by provision of technology based experiences in the University setting.
The use of computers and the Internet is in its infancy in developing countries, if these are used at all, due to limited infrastructure and the attendant high costs of access. Usually, various technologies are used in combination rather than as the sole delivery mechanism. For example, the Kothmale Community Radio Internet uses both radio broadcasts and computer and Internet technologies to facilitate the sharing of information and provide educational opportunities in a rural community in Sri Lanka. The Open University of the United Kingdom (UKOU), established in 1969 as the first educational institution in the world wholly dedicated to open and distance learning, still relies heavily on print-based materials supplemented by radio, television and, in recent years, online programming. Similarly, the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India combines the use of print, recorded audio and video, broadcast radio and television, and audio conferencing technologies.
The term &quot;computer-assisted learning&quot; (CAL) has been increasingly used to describe the use of technology in teaching. Classrooms of the 21st century contain interactive white boards,  tablets,  mp3 players, laptops, etc. Wiki sites are another tool teachers can implement into CAL curricula for students to understand communication and collaboration efforts of group work through electronic means. Teachers are encouraged to embed these technological devices and services in the curriculum in order to enhance students learning and meet the needs of various types of learners.
Adult learning, or adult education, is the practice of  training and developing skills in adults. It is also sometimes referred to as  andragogy (the art and science of helping adults learn).Adult education has become common in many countries. It takes on many forms, ranging from formal class-based learning to self-directed learning and  e-learning. A number of career specific courses such as  veterinary assisting, medical billing and coding,  real estate license,  bookkeeping and many more are now available to students through the Internet.
With the boom of information from availability of knowledge through means of internet and other modern low cost information exchange mechanisms people are beginning to take an attitude of  Lifelong learning. To make knowledge and  self improvement a lifelong focus as opposed to the more traditional view that knowledge and in particular value creating trade skills are to be learned just exclusively in youth.
There has been work on learning styles over the last two decades. Dunn and Dunn focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as  Joseph Renzulli recommended varying teaching strategies.  Howard Gardner identified individual talents or aptitudes in his  Multiple Intelligences theories. Based on the works of Jung, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and  Keirsey Temperament Sorter focused on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of  David Kolb and  Anthony Gregorc's Type Delineator follows a similar but more simplified approach.
It is currently fashionable to divide education into different learning &quot;modes&quot;. The learning modalities are probably the most common:
Although it is claimed that, depending on their preferred learning modality, different teaching techniques have different levels of effectiveness, recent research has argued &quot;there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice.&quot;
A consequence of this theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them. Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that  learning styles such as VAK are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called  teachers, and they direct the education of  students and might draw on many  subjects like  reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called  teachers, instructors, or  professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.
 Education theory can refer to either a normative or a descriptive theory of education. In the first case, a theory means a postulation about what ought to be. It provides the &quot;goals, norms, and standards for conducting the process of education.&quot; In the second case, it means &quot;an hypothesis or set of hypotheses that have been verified by observation and experiment.&quot; A descriptive theory of education can be thought of as a conceptual scheme that ties together various &quot;otherwise discrete particulars. . .For example, a cultural theory of education shows how the concept of culture can be used to organize and unify the variety of facts about how and what people learn.&quot; Likewise, for example, there is the  behaviorist theory of education that comes from educational psychology and the  functionalist theory of education that comes from  sociology of education.
It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of  economic growth. Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However,  technology transfer requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of &quot; human capital&quot;. Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills.
At the individual level, there is a large literature, generally related back to the work of  Jacob Mincer, on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital of the individual. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.
Economists  Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis famously argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the  egalitarian goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production on the other.
The history of education according to Dieter Lenzen, president of the  Freie Universität Berlin 1994, &quot;began either millions of years ago or at the end of 1770&quot;. Education as a science cannot be separated from the educational traditions that existed before. Adults trained the young of their society in the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The evolution of culture, and human beings as a species depended on this practice of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling continued from one generation to the next. Oral language developed into written symbols and letters. The depth and breadth of knowledge that could be preserved and passed soon increased exponentially. When cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc., formal education, and schooling, eventually followed. Schooling in this sense was already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.
The first large established university is thought to be  Nalanda established in 427 A.D in India. At its peak, the university attracted scholars and students from as far away as Tibet, China, Greece, and Persia. The first university establishments in the western world are thought to be  University of Bologna (founded in 1088) and later Oxford university (founded around 1096).
In the West,  Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC. Plato was the  Classical Greek  philosopher, mathematician and writer of philosophical dialogues who founded the  Academy in  Athens which was the first institution of higher learning in the  Western world. Inspired by the admonition of his mentor, Socrates, prior to his unjust execution that &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;, Plato and his student, the political scientist Aristotle, helped lay the foundations of  Western philosophy and science.
The city of Alexandria in Egypt was founded in 330BC, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of the  Western World. The city hosted such leading lights as the mathematician Euclid and anatomist  Herophilus; constructed the great Library of Alexandria; and translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek (called the  Septuagint for it was the work of 70 translators). Greek civilization was subsumed within the Roman Empire. While the Roman Empire and its new Christian religion survived in an increasingly Hellenised form in the Byzantine Empire centered at Constantinople in the East, Western civilization suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in AD 476.
In the East, Confucius (551-479), of the  State of Lu, was China's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan and Vietnam. He gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his  Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in the East into the modern era.
In Western Europe after the  Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church emerged as the unifying force. Initially the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe, the church established  Cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these ultimately evolved into  medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential  Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the  University of Naples,  Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation; and Saint  Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research The  University of Bologne is considered the oldest continually operating university.
Elsewhere during the Middle Ages,  Islamic science and  mathematics flourished under the Islamic  caliphate established across the Middle East, extending from the  Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Indus in the east and to the  Almoravid Dynasty and  Mali Empire in the south.
The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a  new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European  Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilisations — as with the  Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and the West, translating Western works like Euclids Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for Western audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in the West.
Nowadays some kind of education is compulsory to all people in most countries. Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.
As an academic field, philosophy of education is a &quot;the philosophical study of education and its problems...its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy&quot;. &quot;The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.&quot; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of  metaphysics,  epistemology,  axiology and the philosophical approaches ( speculative, prescriptive, and/or  analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy,  education policy, and  curriculum, as well as the process of  learning, to name a few. For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between  education theory and practice.
 Chesterton said, &quot;Modern education means handing down the customs of the minority, and rooting out the customs of the majority.&quot;
Individuals purposes for pursuing education can vary. However in early age the focus is generally around developing basic  Interpersonal communication and literacy skills in order to further ability to learn more complex skills and subjects. After acquiring these basic abilities education is commonly focused towards individuals gaining necessary knowledge and skills to improve ability to create value and a  livelihood for themselves. Satisfying personal curiosities (Education for the sake of itself) and desire for  Personal development, to &quot;better oneself&quot; without career based reasons for doing so are also common reasons why people pursue education and use schools.
Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the  social psychology of schools as organizations. Although the terms &quot;educational psychology&quot; and &quot;school psychology&quot; are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as  educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as  school psychologists. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as  gifted children and those with specific  disabilities.
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including  instructional design,  educational technology, curriculum development,  organizational learning,  special education and  classroom management. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to  cognitive science and the  learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).
The  sociology of education is the study of how social institutions and forces affect educational processes and outcomes, and vice versa. By many, education is understood to be a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater equality and acquiring wealth and status for all (Sargent 1994). Learners may be motivated by aspirations for progress and betterment. Learners can also be motivated by their interest in the subject area or specific skill they are trying to learn. In fact, learner-responsibility education models are driven by the interest of the learner in the topic to be studied.
Education is perceived as a place where children can develop according to their unique needs and potentialities. The purpose of education can be to develop every individual to their full potential. The understanding of the goals and means of educational  socialization processes differs according to the  sociological paradigm used.
 Universal Primary Education is one of the eight international  Millennium Development Goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the  Overseas Development Institute have indicated that the main obstacles to receiving more funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. Additionally,  Transparency International has identified  corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa. Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the recurrent costs involved. There is economic pressure from those parents who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.
A study conducted by the  UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:

       
Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and  developing countries. There are charities dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials, for example, the  One Laptop per Child project.
The  OLPC foundation, a group out of  MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a  $100 laptop for delivering  educational software. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.
In Africa, the  New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an &quot; e-school program&quot; to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and  internet access within 10 years. An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.
India is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to deliver  distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the  Indian Space Research Organization launched  EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.
Education is becoming increasingly international. The most represented case is the spread of mass schooling. Mass schooling has implanted the fundamental concepts that everyone has a right to be educated regardless of his/her cultural background and gender differences. The system has also promoted the global rules and norms of how the school should operate and what is education. Though the system can have variations in local, regional, and country level, the similarities — in systems or even in ideas — that schools share also enable the exchange among students at all levels which are also playing an increasingly important role in globalization process. In Europe, for example, the Socrates- Erasmus Program stimulates exchanges across European universities. Also, the  Soros Foundation provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the  International Baccalaureate have contributed to the internationalization of education. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience. The  global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes. This facilitates the globalization of education.

Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the  social psychology of schools as organizations. Although the terms &quot;educational psychology&quot; and &quot;school psychology&quot; are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as  educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as  school psychologists. Educational psychology is concerned with how students learn and develop, often focusing on subgroups such as  gifted children and those subject to specific  disabilities.
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology and also between Engineering and Physics. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including  instructional design,  educational technology, curriculum development,  organizational learning,  special education and  classroom management. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to  cognitive science and the  learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.
To understand the characteristics of learners in childhood,  adolescence,  adulthood, and  old age, educational psychology develops and applies theories of human  development. Often cast as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities ( cognition), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.
For example, educational psychologists have researched the instructional applicability of  Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.
Piaget proposed a developmental theory of  moral reasoning in which children progress from a naive understanding of  morality based on behaviour and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by  Kohlberg into a stage theory of moral development. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behaviour. For example, other factors such as  modeling (as described by the  social cognitive theory of morality) are required to explain  bullying.
 Rudolf Steiner's model of  child development interrelates physical, emotional, cognitive, and moral development in developmental stages similar to those later described by  Piaget.
Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of  epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.
Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in intelligence,  creativity,  cognitive style,  motivation, and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),  learning disability,  dyslexia, and  speech disorder. Less common disabilities include  mental retardation, hearing impairment,  cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and blindness.
Although theories of intelligence have been discussed by philosophers since Plato, intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single, scalar  factor ( Spearman's  general intelligence), multiple factors (as in  Sternberg's  triarchic theory of intelligence and  Gardner's  theory of multiple intelligences), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the  Stanford-Binet IQ test and the  WISC are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as  gifted are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as  phonological awareness.
Two fundamental assumptions that underlie formal education systems are that students (a) retain knowledge and skills they acquire in school, and (b) can apply them in situations outside the classroom. But are these assumptions accurate? Research has found that, even when students report not using the knowledge acquired in school, a considerable portion is retained for many years and long term retention is strongly dependent on the initial level of mastery. One study found that university students who took a child development course and attained high grades showed, when tested 10 years later, average retention scores of about 30%, whereas those who obtained moderate or lower grades showed average retention scores of about 20%. There is much less consensus on the crucial question of how much knowledge acquired in school  transfers to tasks encountered outside formal educational settings, and how such transfer occurs. Some psychologists claim that research evidence for this type of far transfer is scarce, while others claim there is abundant evidence of far transfer in specific domains. Several perspectives have been established within which the theories of learning used in educational psychology are formed and contested. These include  behaviorism,  cognitivism,  social cognitive theory, and  constructivism. This section summarizes how educational psychology has researched and applied theories within each of these perspectives.
 Applied behavior analysis, a set of techniques based on the behavioural principles of  operant conditioning, is effective in a range of educational settings. For example, teachers can improve student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behaviour, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of  self-determination theory, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine  intrinsic motivation. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior. But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation. Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis, including  Pivotal Response Therapy which is used to treat Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioural perspective perhaps because it admits causally related mental constructs such as  traits,  beliefs, memories,  motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories posit memory structures that are thought to determine how information is  perceived,  processed, stored,  retrieved and  forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by  Allan Paivio's  dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and  cognitive load theory to explain how people learn from  multimedia presentations.
The spaced learning effect, a cognitive phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within education. For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (see figure). Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using  mnemonics for immediate and delayed retention of information.
 Problem solving, regarded by many cognitive psychologists as fundamental to learning, is an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a  schema retrieved from long term memory. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema. The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of  analogical thinking to problem solving.
Social cognitive theory is a highly influential fusion of behavioural, cognitive and social elements that was initially developed by educational psychologist  Albert Bandura. In its earlier, neo-behavioural incarnation called social learning theory, Bandura emphasized the process of  observational learning in which a learner's behavior changes as a result of observing others' behavior and its consequences. The theory identified several factors that determine whether observing a model will affect behavioural or cognitive change. These factors include the learner's developmental status, the perceived prestige and competence of the model, the consequences received by the model, the relevance of the model's behaviors and consequences to the learner's goals, and the learner's  self-efficacy. The concept of self-efficacy, which played an important role in later developments of the theory, refers to the learner's belief in his or her ability to perform the modeled behaviour.
An  experiment by Schunk and Hanson, that studied grade 2 students who had previously experienced difficulty in learning subtraction, illustrates the type of research stimulated by social learning theory. One group of students observed a subtraction demonstration by a teacher and then participated in an instructional program on subtraction. A second group observed other grade 2 students performing the same subtraction procedures and then participated in the same instructional program. The students who observed peer models scored higher on a subtraction post-test and also reported greater confidence in their subtraction ability. The results were interpreted as supporting the  hypothesis that perceived similarity of the model to the learner increases self-efficacy, leading to more effective learning of modeled behaviour. It is supposed that peer modeling is particularly effective for students who have low self-efficacy.
Over the last decade, much research activity in educational psychology has focused on developing theories of  self-regulated learning (SRL) and  metacognition. These theories work from the central premise that effective learners are active agents who construct knowledge by setting goals, analysing tasks, planning strategies and monitoring their understanding. Research has indicated that learners' who are better at goal setting and self-monitoring tend to have greater intrinsic task interest and  self-efficacy; and that teaching learning strategies can increase academic achievement.
 Constructivism refers to a category of learning theories in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior knowledge of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with Piaget's learning theory, from  social constructivism. A dominant influence on the latter type is  Lev Vygotsky's work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky's theory,  Jerome Bruner and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of  instructional scaffolding, in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.
Vygotsky's version of  constructivist theory has led to the view that behaviour, skills, attitudes and beliefs are inherently  situated, that is, bound to a specific sociocultural setting. According to this view, the learner is enculturated through social interactions within a  community of practice. The social constructivist view of learning has spawned approaches to teaching and learning such as  cognitive apprenticeship, in which the tacit components of a complex skill are made explicit through conversational interactions occurring between expert and novice in the setting in which the skill is embedded.
 Motivation is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behaviour. Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the  volition or  will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and  intrinsic motivation, the personally held  goals that guide their behaviour, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure.
A form of  attribution theory developed by  Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of  shame and  embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of  guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.
Motivational theories also explain how  learners' goals affect the way that they engage with academic tasks. Those who have mastery goals strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have performance approach goals strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have performance avoidance goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks,  creativity and  intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor  concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and  test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.
The research methods used in educational psychology tend to be drawn from psychology and other social sciences. There is also a history of significant methodological innovation by educational psychologists, and psychologists investigating educational problems. Research methods address problems in both  research design and  data analysis. Research design informs the planning of experiments and observational studies to ensure that their results have  internal,  external and  ecological validity. Data analysis encompasses methods for processing both quantitive (numerical) and qualitative (non-numerical) research data. Although, historically, the use of quantitative methods was often considered an essential mark of scholarship, modern educational psychology research uses both  quantitative and  qualitative methods.
Perhaps first among the important methodological innovations of educational psychology was the development and application of  factor analysis by  Charles Spearman. Factor analysis is mentioned here as one example of the many  multivariate statistical methods used by educational psychologists. Factor analysis is used to summarize relationships among a large set of variables or test questions, develop theories about mental constructs such as self-efficacy or anxiety, and assess the reliability and validity of test scores. Over one hundred years after its introduction by Spearman, factor analysis has become a research staple figuring prominently in educational psychology journals.
Because educational  assessment is fundamental to most quantitative research in the field, educational psychologists have made significant contributions to the field of  psychometrics. For example,  alpha, the widely used measure of test  reliability was developed by educational psychologist  Lee Cronbach. The reliability of assessments are routinely reported in quantitative educational research. Although, originally, educational measurement methods were built on  classical test theory,  item response theory and  Rasch models are now used extensively in educational measurement worldwide. These models afford advantages over classical test theory, including the capacity to produce standard errors of measurement for each score or pattern of scores on assessments and the capacity to handle missing responses.
 Meta-analysis, the combination of individual research results to produce a quantitative  literature review, is another methodological innovation with a close association to educational psychology. In a meta-analysis,  effect sizes that represent, for example, the differences between treatment groups in a set of similar experiments, are averaged to obtain a single aggregate value representing the best  estimate of the effect of treatment. Several decades after  Pearson's work with early versions of meta-analysis,  Glass published the first application of modern meta-analytic techniques and triggered their broad application across the social and biomedical sciences. Today, meta-analysis is among the most common types of literature review found in educational psychology research.
Other quantitative research issues associated with educational psychology include the use of nested research designs (e.g., a student nested within a classroom, which is nested within a school, which is nested within a district, etc.) and the use of longitudinal statistical models to measure change.
Qualitative methods are used in educational studies whose purpose is to describe events, processes and situations of theoretical significance. The qualitative methods used in educational psychology often derive from anthropology, sociology or  sociolinguistics. For example, the anthropological method of  ethnography has been used to describe teaching and learning in classrooms. In studies of this type, the researcher may gather detailed field notes as a  participant observer or passive observer. Later, the notes and other data may be categorized and interpreted by methods such as  grounded theory.  Triangulation, the practice of cross-checking findings with multiple data sources, is highly valued in qualitative research.
 Case studies are forms of qualitative research focusing on a single person, organization, event, or other entity. In one case study, researchers conducted a 150-minute, semi-structured  interview with a 20-year old woman who had a history of  suicidal thinking between the ages of 14 to 18. They analyzed an audio-recording of the interview to understand the roles of cognitive development,  identity formation and  social attachment in ending her suicidal thinking.
Qualitative analysis is most often applied to verbal data from sources such as conversations, interviews,  focus groups, and personal journals. Qualitative methods are thus, typically, approaches to gathering, processing and reporting verbal data. One of the most commonly used methods for qualitative research in educational psychology is  protocol analysis. In this method the research participant is asked to  think aloud while performing a task, such as solving a math problem. In protocol analysis the verbal data is thought to indicate which information the subject is attending to, but is explicitly not interpreted as an explanation or justification for behaviour. In contrast, the method of verbal analysis does admit learners' explanations as a way to reveal their  mental model or  misconceptions (e.g., of the laws of motion). The most fundamental operations in both protocol and verbal analysis are segmenting (isolating) and categorizing sections of verbal data.  Conversation analysis and  discourse analysis, sociolinguistic methods that focus more specifically on the structure of conversational interchange (e.g., between a teacher and student), have been used to assess the process of conceptual change in science learning. Qualitative methods are also used to analyse information in a variety of media, such as students' drawings and  concept maps, video-recorded interactions, and computer log records.
 Instructional design, the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a  taxonomy of educational objectives created by  Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched  mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction.  Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of  task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relations.
Research on  classroom management and pedagogy is conducted to guide teaching practice and form a foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of classroom management are to create an environment conducive to learning and to develop students' self-management skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher-student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behaviour, and use counselling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems.
Introductory educational psychology is a commonly required area of study in most North American teacher education programs. When taught in that context, its content varies, but it typically emphasizes learning theories (especially cognitively oriented ones), issues about motivation, assessment of students' learning, and classroom management. A developing  Wikibook about educational psychology gives more detail about the educational psychology topics that are typically presented in preservice teacher education.
Educational psychology cannot claim priority in the systematic analysis of educational processes.  Philosophers of education such as  Democritus,  Quintilian,  Vives and  Comenius, had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the  beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s. Instead, aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the  scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational problems. Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. In his famous series of lectures Talks to Teachers on Psychology, published in 1899 and now regarded as the first educational psychology textbook, the pioneering American psychologist  William James commented that:
According to  Berliner educational psychology theorists' attitude to the world of educational practice has shifted from initial interest to disdain, and eventually to respect.
In 1912, Thorndike, who developed the theory of  instrumental conditioning, presaged later work on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:
The following persons were selected and featured in a recent biographical history of educational psychology as having made significant contributions to the field:
A person may be considered an educational psychologist after completing a graduate  degree in educational psychology or a closely related field. Universities establish educational psychology graduate programs in either psychology departments or, more commonly, faculties of education.
Educational psychologists work in a variety of settings. Some work in university settings where they carry out research on the cognitive and social processes of human development, learning and education. Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.
Educational psychologists who work in k-12 school settings (called  school psychologists in the United States) are trained at the  masters and  doctoral levels. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioural intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention.
In the UK, status as a Chartered Educational Psychologist is gained by completing:
The previous requirement to train and work for two years as a teacher has now been abandoned.
Employment for psychologists in the United States is expected to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18-26%. One in four psychologist are employed in educational settings. In the United States, the median  salary for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is $58,360 as of May 2004.
In recent decades the participation of women as professional researchers in North American educational psychology has risen dramatically. The percentage of female authors of peer-reviewed journal articles doubled from 1976 (24%) to 1995 (51%), and has since remained constant. Female membership on educational psychology journal editorial boards increased from 17% in 1976 to 47% in 2004. Over the same period, the proportion of chief editor positions held by women increased from 22% to 70%.
Although not exhaustive, the table to the right lists  peer-reviewed journals in educational psychology and related fields. The  impact factor is the average number of  citations per article in each journal.

Abidjan is the economic and former official capital of Côte d'Ivoire, while the current capital is Yamoussoukro. As of 2011 it was the largest city in the nation and the third-largest  French-speaking city in the world, after Paris, and Kinshasa but before Montréal. It has, according to the authorities of the country in 2006, 5,068,858 residents in the metropolitan area and 3,796,677 residents in the municipality. Only Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria, has a larger number of inhabitants in this region. Considered a cultural hub of West Africa, Abidjan is characterized by a high level of industrialization and urbanization. The city stands in  Ébrié Lagoon, on several converging peninsulas and islands, connected by bridges.
The city grew after the construction of a new  wharf in 1931 and its designation as the capital of the then French colony in 1933. The completion of the  Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled it to become an important  sea port. In 1983, Yamoussoukro was designated as the nation's capital, but most government offices and foreign  embassies are still in Abidjan.
Abidjan lies on the south-east coast of the country in the Gulf of Guinea. The city lies on the  Ébrié Lagoon. The business district Le Plateau is the centre of the city, along with  Cocody',  Deux Plateaux (the wealthiest neighbourhood and a hubbub for diplomats), and the  slum of  Adjamé on the north shore of the lagoon.  Treichville and  Marcory lie to the south, Commune d' Attecoube by its extension to Locodjro and Abobo Doume and  Yopougon to the west, and Gbagba and N'Gbotroya (Locodjro) called today Boulay Island in the middle of the lagoon. Further south lies  Port Bouët, home to the  airport and main  seaport. Abidjan is located at 5°25' North, 4°2' West (5.41667, −4.03333).
The city has a  tropical monsoon climate with a long rainy season from May through July, a short rainy season (September–November) and two dry seasons, though rain is seen even during the dry season. Abidjan is generally humid throughout the year, with humidity generally at or higher than 80 percent. During the rainy season it can rain continuously for several consecutive days, or intensely for over an hour. The rainfall is abundant at about 2,000 mm per year. The monthly rainfall varies between about 40 mm and 500 mm in January to June and the temperature is almost constant at around 27 °C (80.6 °F).
Abidjan is composed of two parts (northern Abidjan and southern Abidjan) with ten communes.
The main towns which are near Abidjan are  Jacqueville,  Grand-Lahou and  Dabou in the west,  Sikensi,  Tiassalé,  Agboville,  Adzopé and  Aleppo in the north, and  Grand-Bassam to the east.
The towns of  Songon,  Bingerville and  Anyama were incorporated in 2001 into the Department of Abidjan.
According to  oral tradition  Ébrié reported in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Côte d'Ivoire, the name of Abidjan, Abidjan at the time, was invented as a misunderstanding. A  legend narrated that an old man returning from his farm with his arm filled with branches probably intended to repair the roof of his house, met him on his way to ruin a European  explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village. The old man did not speak the language of the white man thought he understood that he wondered what he was doing in those places. Terrorized by this unexpected meeting, he fled shouting &quot;min-chan m'bidjan,&quot; which means language Ébrié: &quot;I just cut the leaves.&quot; The white man thought he had the answer to his question carefully and wrote down on his notepad Abidjan.
A slightly different and less elaborate version of the legend: When the first colonists asked a native man the name of the place, the man misunderstood and replied &quot;M'bi min djan&quot;: &quot;I've just been cutting leaves&quot;.
Abidjan was originally a small fishing village. In 1896, following a series of deadly yellow fever epidemics, the French colonists who first settled in Bassam decided to move to a safer place. Their movement was followed by the colonial government created in 1899, although nearby  Bingerville became capital of the French colony from 1900 until 1934.
The future Abidjan, situated on the edge of the lagoon n'doupé (&quot;the lagoon in hot water, &quot;future &quot;Ébrié Lagoon&quot;), offered more space and greater opportunities for trade expansion. The wharf in Petit Bassam (now  Port-Bouet) south of the town, quickly overtook in importance the wharf of  Grand-Bassam, hitherto the main economic access to the colony. From 1904, when  Bingerville was not yet complete, Abidjan became the main economic hub of the colony of Côte d'Ivoire and a prime channel for distributing products to the European hinterland, particularly through the Lebanese community which was increasingly important.
 Henri Terrasson de Fougères became governor of French Sudan in 1924, and remained the governor until his death in 1931. One of the main streets of Abidjan still bears his name.
In 1931,  Plateau and what became  Treichville were connected approximately at the position of the bridge Houphouet Boigny by a floating bridge. That year, it was first addressed as the streets of Abidjan. It temporarily held the name in 1964, under the leadership of Mayor Konan Kanga, completed by the Americans in 1993.
Abidjan became the third capital of Côte d'Ivoire, after  Grand-Bassam and  Bingerville by a  decree on 10 August 1933. Several villages in Tchaman were then deserted. It is particularly Adjame (&quot;centre&quot; in Tchaman), located at the north of the Plateau, which is still the leader of the Tchaman community.
South of the Plateau district (the current central district of the city of Abidjan), the village of Dugbeo was moved across the lagoon to Anoumabo, &quot;the forest of fruit bats&quot;, which became the neighbourhood of  Treichville (now Commikro The &quot;town clerks). This area was thus renamed in 1934 in honour of  Marcel Treich-Laplénie (1860–1890), the first  explorer of Côte d'Ivoire and its first colonial administrator, considered its founder. Instead of Dugbeyo, is the current Treich Laplénie Avenue, the bus station and water lagoon buses in Plateau, and the Avenue  Charles de Gaulle (commonly called Rue du Commerce).
The city was laid out like the usual colonial towns on the basis of a rather utopian plan.  Le Plateau (&quot;m'brato&quot; in Tchaman) was inhabited by settlers. In the north, the city was inhabited by the colonized. The two zones were separated by the  Gallieni Military Barracks, instead of the current courthouse.
Near the port and along a petanque, originally named Boulevard de Marseille, facetious settlers who had &quot;borrowed&quot; a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a sand track. This is the  legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in  Cocody. A  racetrack was built in the south of the city that never stops growing.
Le Plateau in the 1940s, the hotel grew and became Bardon Park Hotel, the first air-conditioned hotel working in  francophone Africa.
After independence in 1960, the old settler town became the administrative centre and business headquarters of the Presidency. The axis south of  Treichville, towards the international airport and the beaches, became the headquarters of European and middle-class Abidjan. There, in November 2004, focus was on the anti-French riots and looting. The  Cocody district, famous for a gentleman embodied in film by  Jean Marais, which should be a vast indigenous district according to the colonial urban pattern, became an upscale neighbourhood including the presidential residence, the embassy of France, Hotel Ivorian (which for a long time, was the only African hotel to have a skating rink), and since 2006, the largest U.S. embassy in Africa. Large areas have grown popular among these clusters, extended by areas of poor housing and poverty fed by the rural exodus and sub-regional immigration.
In 1983 the village of Yamoussoukro (literally the city of Queen Yamoussoukro) became the new political capital of Ivory Coast under the leadership of President  Felix Houphouet-Boigny who was born in Yamoussoukro.
Since 1999, Abidjan has been penalized by the political and economic Ivorian disaster. Since the 80s, despite undeniable improvements and because of the negligence of officials, corruption as well as general degradation of the city of Abidjan has been prevalent. In 2006, the mass poisoning of people by pollutants dumped in landfills are illustrations of an inevitable drama. ( case of the Probo Koala).
Formerly managed by the French &quot;colonial administration&quot;, Abidjan became a municipality in 1956, and was divided into administrative areas by lagoons. Its first municipal council was elected on 18 November 1956, and the first mayor in the context of the Framework Law of 1956 was president  Félix Houphouët-Boigny. A law of 1978 established twenty-seven municipalities full year in the country. After the application of this new organization,  Dioulo Emmanuel was elected mayor of Abidjan on 30 November 1980.
Since 2001, the city has been run as a department divided into ten municipalities (communes) and with three new sub-prefectures at  Anyama,  Bingerville and  Songon. The post of Mayor of Abidjan was replaced by the District Governor, appointed by the head of state. The position has been occupied by  Pierre Djedji Amondji since 2002. However, each of the ten municipalities of Abidjan has its own municipal council headed by a mayor. The last municipal elections were held in March 2001.
The communes of Abobo, Adjamé, Attécoubé, Cocody, and Plateau are located north of the Ébrié Lagoon (hence the name &quot;Abidjan North&quot;). This is the continental part of Abidjan. The commune of Yopougon straddles the lagoon, with part lying north and part south of that body of water. The communes of  Treichville, Koumassi, Marcory and Port-Bouet in Abidjan are south of the lagoon.
 Blokosso and Locodjro villages are included within the city and maintain cultural identity in urban areas.
The  University of Abidjan, several technical colleges, and the  National Library of Côte d'Ivoire and  National museum are in the city.
Sights in Abidjan include  St Paul's Cathedral, designed by  Aldo Spirito, the  Cocody Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art and the Parc du Banco rainforest reserve. Le Plateau is known for its skyscrapers, unusual in West Africa.
Le Plateau is the business centre of Abidjan. With its gleaming skyscrapers, chic boutiques and outdoor cafes, le Plateau is a favourite place of business travellers. There are many different banks located in the le Plateau district.
The majority of Ivorian government institutions are still located in Abidjan until the end of the transfer of the Ivorian capital Yamoussoukro: the President's office in  Cocody, the parliament, the Constitutional Council, the Supreme Court (Court of Cassation, Council state and the court of accounts), the Chancellery of the National Order. However, the current president,  Laurent Gbagbo, elected in 2000, decided to give effect to the project of making the political capital Yamoussoukro in Côte d'Ivoire, despite the events since 2002. This recent decision is a consensus on the part of the country's political leaders.
Government offices are located in  Le Plateau in the administrative district of Abidjan, Boulevard Carde or Angoulvant Boulevard (near the Cathedral of St. Paul of Abidjan), or elsewhere in the great buildings of the town.
Since 2004, when virtually all prisoners of Abidjan (MACA ...) are released from prison, insecurity has increased significantly: increase in crimes and misdemeanors, increased drug seizures. Besides the presence of the police, gendarmerie, the impartial forces (UNOCI whose headquarters are in  Attécoubé and a large base to  Biétry), French soldiers based in  Port-Bouet and the Ivorian army, were created in the 2000 by the CECOS and several private security firms.
In 2007, Permanent Dangerby  Pierre Laba a film about the laxity of the police against the banditry in major African cities in the image of the Ivorian capital was out in cinema
Abidjan is divided into districts, each of which has a police station. The municipal police and national police are distinguished.
The police's training centre (National Police Academy) located in the town of Cocody, where all police are trained. They are recruited by competitive examination held by the police administration. The policy includes several sections, it is the BAE (Anti Riot Squad), whose base is located in the Yopougon north of the city, the CRS (Republican Security Company), whose main base is located in Williamsville (Adjame) also includes a secondary base called CRS2 which is located in zone 4 in the town of Marcory (central capital).
The Force and CECOS (Command Centre Security Operations) accompany the police.
The main base of the gendarmerie is Agban (common Adjamé), another in Abobo and Kumasi, It also has training school &quot;School de Gendarmerie&quot; in Cocody and the city.
Since 2000, Côte d'Ivoire has experienced a sharp rise in drug trafficking. The drug dens occur mainly in informal settlements as rail or behind  Abobo  Adjamé  Bramokoté. Surveys show that the drug comes from Asia responding to a recent spike in demand among young unemployed and Ivorian vagrants. The Ivorian police are increasingly focused on the fight against trafficking and drug use in the district of Abidjan. A report by the Office of the UN says the West Africa plays an increasingly important transit of cocaine to the Latin American Europe. According to an investigation by the commission for the fight against drug trafficking UN, 46 percent of youth in West Africa is dependent on the drug. In May 2007, seven drug houses were dismantled and 191 people arrested including a military officer. · .
Abidjan is home to  Port-Bouet, one of the six French military bases that still exist in Africa (Dakar, Libreville,  Bouar CAR,  N'Djamena and Djibouti). Thousands of people live there, around the 43rd BIMA which is permanently parked in accordance with established defense agreements 24 April 1961 linking the two countries The presence of the French military base on the territory of Ivory Coast.
Abidjan is the regional headquarters of major international institutions:  UNICEF,  UNDP, WHO,  WFP,  UNOPS,  UNFPA, ILO,  IMF, etc.
The great nations of the world all have representation in Abidjan, most of which serve sub-region
The American Embassy is located in Côte d'Ivoire while the  African Development Bank (ADB) moved for a while to Tunisia, which is the largest financial institution in Africa.
Abidjan is sister cities with:
The 1998 Census revealed Abidjan's population to be 2,877,923. Estimates for the population of the Abidjan metropolitan area as of 2005 vary between 4 and 5 million inhabitants. As Abidjan is inhabited by people from a wide array of different ethnicities, the French language is used as the language of communication in the  metropolitan area, which is the third-largest French speaking metropolitan area in the world after Paris and Kinshasa. A specific colloquial Abidjan French has even appeared, with a pronunciation and some colloquial words distinct from standard French. The area of Abidjan is recognized as one of only two areas in Africa where French (colloquial Abidjan French) is truly a native tongue, the other one being Libreville, Gabon.
The figures as of 2006 estimate the Abidjanaise population at 3,796,677. In 2006, the metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase can be attributed to the displacement caused by the war (since September 2002). This city has many inhabitants who come to live downtown because they seek employment and safer lodgings.
By 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year: a doubling every 6 or 7 years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3–6%. Growth by birth rate was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. Positive migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within Côte d'Ivoire, and about 30,000 from abroad per year. From within Côte d'Ivoire, the migration pattern was dominated by  Akan (South-east, 48%), then  Mandé (North-west, 24%) and  Krou (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was Burkinabes (30%), Malians (22%), Ghanaians (19%), Nigerien (11%), and Guineans (9%). It should be noted that of the Non-African migration, Lebanese migration exceeded that of Europeans, with the French being largest of these. All in all, non-African migration represents hardly 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which is still the highest in the area.
The last population census in the country took place in 1998. It presented 2,877,948 inhabitants for the city.
The figures for 2006 estimated the population of Abidjan to 3,796,677 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase is mainly due to war-displaced since the events of September 2002. The town hosts many people in search of both jobs and a more secure
It planned to hold a new census in 2008.
The traditional language of the city was  Ébrié. Since independence, the  official language in Abidjan and throughout Côte d'Ivoire is French.  French spoken in Abidjan is called French or French Ivorian Popular moussa. This differs from the standard French pronunciation. Another form of spoken French in Abidjan is nouchi which is a kind of popular slang in youth. The lingua franca, spoken and understood by most of the trading population of Abidjan, is the  Dioula. Finally, the city hosts many Ivorians from all over the country, all the vernacular languages of the country, about sixty, are spoken the l'attié, le baoulé, le bété, le wobé
Abidjan is still surrounded by more than thirty villages where primarily Baulé and Ébrié are spoken.
In Côte d'Ivoire, the enrollment rate is 74 percent and access to secondary education is limited by an entrance in the sixth stage after which 1 / 3 of students is allowed to continue their studies 24percent of the student population resides in Abidjan .out of 20percent of the population. Abidjan is the location of the main educational institutions in Côte d'Ivoire. These includes the Lycée Classique d'Abidjan, the Lycée Sainte-Marie de Cocody Lycée Boy Bingerville Mami Adjoua the Lyceum, the school-Blaise Pascal Abidjan is a French school (mean school French school who signed an agreement with the ADFE.
The city has a care package complete. Besides, many traditional medicine establishments sell old drugs in the street. There are numerous health centers and pharmacies, many pharmacopoeias. The city has more than fifty clinics, and over sixty specialist (veterinary,  dermatology, dental,  optometry, motherhood, psychology,  pediatrics, etc.).
Modern districts like  Plateau or  Cocody have developed like those in Europe with the construction of large office towers, apartment buildings between the 1970s and the mid-1980.
Traditional neighborhoods like  Treichville or  Marcory maintained the system of &quot;concessions&quot; where housing is adjacent to the plant and the system of &quot;court&quot; group of which several houses, within the normal organization and multi centuries-old villages Africans.
The district of  Cocody is also home to many single-storey wooden villas, surrounded by vast gardens where there is lush vegetation fed by heavy rains that water the city. Recently, it became &quot;fashionable&quot; for wealthier inhabitants to construct villas in imitation of Greek temples in this district. In addition, many houses were built on stilts on the edge of the Ébrié Lagoon.
The town hall, a fine example of modernist architecture, was designed by architect  Henry Chomette.
The urban network is disrupted as Abidjan has seen its population double every seven years since 1945. Rural people attracted by the opportunities of the future of the city form the bulk of inward migration. Abidjan represents 45 percent of city dwellers in Ivory Coast and 20 percent of the overall population. However, if a significant rise was observed for half a century, its growth would not have been more than 4.5 percent per year (compared to 10 percent from 1960 to 1990) and we find more than one third of Rural involved in the growth of the city (two thirds from 1960 to 1990). Despite this decline, the city is still the most populated in comparison to the second largest city in the country, Bouaké (1,500,000 inhabitants) or the political capital, Yamoussoukro (100,000 inhabitants)
Despite the case of the Probo Koala-2006, sanitary conditions which affect Africa could be solved in Abidjan. Indeed, a contract was signed between China and Côte d'Ivoire: a Chinese company handling urban waste and industrial plans to treat all waste district this transformation also create daily cleaning. The project is funded 60 percent by China and 40 percent by Côte d'Ivoire. A gigantic waste treatment centre is built at Attengué. 15,000 permanent jobs and 5,000 seasonal jobs will be created through this project.
The last building program of roads in Abidjan, led to the consolidation of certain roads in the capital in 1994. Since May 2007, the company Ageroute (Road Management Agency) is undertaking major operations in Abidjan and  Anyama. These works relating to roads badly damaged, suffering from lack of maintenance, and heavy rain events, gutters, roads not tarred · . The District and BNETD plan to rehabilitate and construct 400 to 500 kilometers, providing them with a quality 15 to 20 years of life.
Improvements include the rehabilitation of roads in Abidjan and  Anyama, construction of drains, the tarring of gravel roads and sanitation of the city by the construction of sewers. These rehabilitations affect all municipalities in Abidjan:
The principal stock exchange of the country, the  Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières (BRVM), is located in the city.  Air Ivoire has its head office in Abidjan.
Prior to its dissolution,  Air Afrique was headquartered in Abidjan.
Major industries include  food processing,  lumber, automobile manufacturing, and the manufacture of textiles,  chemicals, and soap. There is also a large oil refinery.  Kalys Engineering (www.kalysengineering.com), a US based company presided by an ivorian is initiating a homegrow business in Civil Engineering, Environment and the production of Clean Energy from biomass and Municipal Solid Waste. In the nearly year, Kalys Engineering, in partnership with Groupe Eoulee and US world class companies, will get the Akouedo landfill in the production of the Electricity and/or bio-fuel from an average of 1,000 tons/day garbage dumped over 3,000 tons/day generated by the town of Abidjan.
The region of the lagoons is the most industrialized region of the country.
Its industries are mainly Construction and Maintenance with the presence of major international groups: the furnace SETAO, Colas, Bouygues,  Jean Lefebvre, and Swiss Holcim.
There are textile industries with the packaging of the grown cotton in the north either for export or for on-site processing of cloth, canvas, batik clothing and miscellaneous. The textile sector is very dynamic, representing 15.6percent of net investment, 13percent of turnover and 24percent of the value added of Ivorian industry.
There are several oil wells off the coast offshore operations (Côte d'Ivoire is an oil producing country, even if it is not self-sufficient in this area), which leads to the presence chemical industry with refineries pétrole, et un port pour  hydrocarbures., and a port for oil. It also works on stones and precious metals for exportation · .
The city also has a large wood processing activity mainly at the port by river from the forests of central Canada. It is exported either as natural as  mahogany which was already sold two centuries ago by the English Victorian or in a semi-industrialized: peeled wood, plywood, chipboard.
In the food industry mainly include: the production of oil palm, processing of bergamot and Seville oranges, processing of rubber from plantations in the west, the manufacture of beverages from pineapples, oranges and mangoes, and especially the roasting of coffee, robust type, came from the plantations of the West whose country is the third largest producer, behind Colombia and Brazil as well as packaging and processing of cocoa, including  Ivory Coast’s, the world's leading producer to Ghana and Indonesia. (37 percent of cocoa and 10percent of coffee products undergo at least one first local processing). Abidjan is also the first African tuna port, and three plants condition tuna primarily for the European market. This activity generates about 3,000 salaried jobs, and is an important source of foreign exchange.
As in all countries of the Third World developing countries, much of the city's economy lies in what economists describe as informal economy with its many &quot;odd jobs&quot;.
The development of tertiary industry, with the establishment of international commercial banks and the increasing number of service companies of all types, appears to be the trend of recent years. Abidjan is the main financial centre of  French West Africa. The seat of the common purse of West Africa (BRVM) is located in Abidjan. BRVM is mainly dominated by Ivorian firms.
The thermal power plant Azito, built in 1997 in partnership with EDF, located on the Yopougon on the edge of the lagoon and facing Ébrié Island Boulay, alone provides 300 MW. Two other power plants, built in 1984 and 1985, are installed in  Vridi. Several utilities are installed in Abidjan: SOPIE which is a corporation State, ICE and SOPREL, subsidiaries of the French group SAUR (Côté d'Ivoire produces all the electricity it consumes, and exports to neighboring countries, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso through the interconnection.
The production, which increases steadily, and gas storage are provided by two state companies: PETROCI and GESTOCI. A small industry of renewable energy production has also developed.
The city has a powerful fixed telephony network of 450,000 lines (in 2004) managed by Côte d'Ivoire Telecom. Broadband Internet connections, leased lines and ADSL are powered by various providers: Aviso Ivory Coast Telecoms. Africa is Line, Globe Access, Afnet, and as the news portal www.abidjan24.net
Abidjan is home to all the representatives of international financial institutions:  World Bank,  IMF,  ADB,  BOAD, etc. Banking Commission of WAEMU regional stock exchange securities subsidiaries of major international banks: BNP Paribas, General bank, Credit Lyonnais,  Citibank,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Barclays, etc.. Sixteen national banks (SGBCI, BICI, etc..) maintaining a network of 170 branches, seven financial institutions and more than thirty insurance companies make a financial competitive Abidjan that animates the entire West Africa.
Trains on the line to Ouagadougou run from several stations in the city, the most important being in Treichville.  Ferries link Treichville, Abobo-Doumé and Le Plateau.  Felix Houphouet Boigny International Airport serves the city.
SOTRA (Abidjan Transport Company) ensure regular urban transportation in Abidjan via bus, taxi and luggage Line Express.
Sotra has announced the start of work for the use of light rail to Abidjan. The project has three phases at a cost of 125 billion CFA francs for a long loop of 32 km.
It is very difficult to imagine the streets of the city without cabs. There are two kinds: the taxi-meter, color orange, which can travel throughout the city, and woro-woro, yellow and green or blue or orange depending on the commune, which are limited to a neighbourhood. They are often used in taxi mode
Abidjan International Airport has a large capacity that allows it to accommodate all existing large aircraft. Abidjan is located an hour's flight from all the capitals of the sub-region. Abidjan is served by major airlines in the direction of the great capitals of the world. Headquarters of the former multinational African Air company, Abidjan knows a traffic of nearly 900 000 passengers (1995 figure)
The District has several paved streets and boulevards linking the towns between them and the District across the country. Abidjan has a network of urban bypasses.
River transport is already consistent with the fishing smacks and the many boat-buses connecting the various neighborhoods of the city thrives plan lagoon.
Abidjan is also the bridgehead of the country's only highway linking the city to the administrative and political capital, Yamoussoukro.
Abidjan has the biggest port in the sub-region (West Africa), which is also the second biggest in Africa; the biggest being in Lagos. It is a container transshipment port and was opened in 1951 in the presence of the Minister of Overseas and Colonies at the time,  François Mitterrand. Thanks to the 15m deep  Vridi Canal, boats with large draughts can dock in the deep-water port.
The Côte d'Ivoire is in the Franc Zone (where the currency is CFA francs), as part of the West African Economic and Monetary Union ( WAEMU). Abidjan is the economic centre of both the Côte d'Ivoire and of the whole region, including Burkina Faso and Mali; this is mainly because of its deep-water port, which opened in 1951. The road network in Abidjan (5,600 km asphalted in 1995, compared to 1,000kmm in 1970), which covers the whole region, effectively increases its port activity as 50% of the business from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger pass through it.
Abidjan receives the bulk of the country’s industrial activity; its port alone receiving 60% of ivory park industry. Abidjan’s ambitions of oil-production must be noted (off-shore production and especially  refining and distribution). In 1995 the port received 12 million tonnes of traffic, of which 5.5 million tonnes were petroleum products.
The two halves of the city, Northern Abidjan and Southern Abidjan, are joined by the Houphouët-Boigny and De Gaulle bridges. These two bridges are located between  Treichville and  Le Plateau. De Gaulle Bridge extends over the immense Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Boulevard which leads to the airport. Unfortunately, their capacity is markedly insufficient, especially during rush hour times or on the occasion of police and military roadblocks, when there is immense traffic congestion. This assessment prompted the government to consider a construction project for a third possible bridge which would be located between  Cocody and  Marcory. However, due to political upheavals which the country has been experiencing since December 1999, these plans have been suspended, and according to the Minister for Infrastructure of the government under Guillaume Soro, they should have been taken up again in 2008. Yet the project had already been started: people had been relocated and buildings had been destroyed in Marcory, opposite the  Mille Maquis (the famous restaurant la Bâche bleue was moved).
The city is the foothold for the region’s only railway: the Abidjan-Ouagadougou line, with stations in  Treichville,  Abobo and  Adjamé. This line only has two trains, the Gazelle and the Bélier, and links the two capitals in about 40 hours.
The most recent project in Abidjan is one for an electric train which is promised by the Ivory Society of Railroads (SICF).
The development of infrastructural projects has been envisaged, including a suburban train system in Abidjan which is estimated to cost almost 100 billion CFA francs. This suburban train system would link the North-West to the East and North of the city. The project extends over 25 km of railway tracks which as of 2011 were used by the operator  Sitarail, a subsidiary company of the  Bolloré group. The infrastructural works (tracks, electrification, and civil engineers) have been estimated at 40 billion  CFA francs, financed by the State of Côte d'Ivoire and backers ( World Bank and the French Development Agency). In addition, a BOT concession contract would be given to a private operator, over 20–30 years, to operate the network. This operator will be in charge of the acquisition of railway materials, workshop renovation and the implementation of an organisational system. The concession contract has been estimated at around 60 billion  CFA francs.
Abidjan is a unique city in Africa. Its nicknames, such as “Manhattan of the tropics”, “Small Manhattan” or “Pearl of the lagoons”, explain the city’s unpredictable and triumphant image. With its accommodation facilities – such as the Golf Hôtel – and sporting facilities, its lively night life, transport and communication lines as well as its impressiveness, it is the perfect city for business tourism.
Abidjan also has beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the  Vridi area, which are very popular at weekends with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the “ban phenomenon”, which affects practically the whole of the Gulf of Guinea’s coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed.
Generally, in the Côte d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; the country does not appear among common holiday destinations.
Converted in 1926, this park has 3,000 hectares and ancient “sacred wood” lies at the entrance to the city, in the  Attécoubé community, which has been conserved as a relic of the first forest which surrounded the lagoon in the past. A tarmaced road goes straight to the lake at the heart of the park and trails go throughout it. The park is inhabited and there are coffee and  cocoa plantations.
At the edge of the park, a small river serves as a wash-house where the fanicos, laundry men, work after collecting the laundry from the whole of the city. It is one of the ‘small jobs’ which exist in Abidjan.
Overall, the night life in Abidjan is considered to be one of the liveliest in the whole of Africa.
The district has an abundance of night-clubs, maquis, out-door areas and go-go bars. These entertainment platforms provide a musical ‘pipeline’ encompassing mainly DJs,  Coupé Décalé and Zouglou, and, in lesser amounts, other local and international varieties.
Formerly containing only local traditional varieties, Congolese music and Western music, Abidjan’s night life has experienced a positive cultural disruption in its music since the start of the 2000s, with the arrival of  Coupé Décalé.
Indeed, this musical genre was introduced in 2002 by  Douk Saga and  JetSet, with the help of Sagacité, created a phenomenon which has not stopped spreading and reaching out to the hot nights in the capitals of the sub-region. It has given a cultural identity, globally identifiable, to entertainment ‘Made in Côte d'Ivoire’.
The very popular Zouglou additionally benefits “Wôyô” spaces; furnished and dedicated so that the most famous, the Internat at Fitini’s and the Lycee at Vieux Gazeur’s, attract ‘zouglouphiles’ the whole weekend.
 Treichville, with its many maquis, discothèques and jazz clubs, used to be the liveliest area in the city, but since the end of the 90s  Youpougon,  Marcory and  Cocody have taken over this role.
The  Treichville mosque, the  Cocody mosque, the  Plateau Mosque, and  Saint-Paul's Cathedral in Abidjan, created by the architect  Aldo Spirito and inaugurated by Pope John Paul II in 1985, make up the city’s main religious buildings. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of the  Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Abidjan.
Each year film festivals are organised in Abidjan: The Clap-Ivoire festival, the Spanish film festival, the Ivory Coast National Film Festial (FESNACI) – the first of which was organised in 2007, the short film festival (FIMA), which has been organised since 1998 by Hanni Tchelley, the Abidjan Israeli film festival; the fourth one took place in 2006 in the  Goethe Institute.
Several films depict or are devoted to the city:
Abidjan is a turntable for West African music, and a major producer of musical art in Africa. The city attracts the majority of musicians from the Côte d'Ivoire mainly because of its many discothèques, which allow artists to make their debut and express themselves, record companies and national media. Here are a few examples of the most popular artists to have made their debut in Abidjan:  Alpha Blondy,  Aïcha Koné, the group  Magic System,  Meiway, and  Tiken Jah Fakoly, as well as Gadji Celi, Chantal Taiba, Nayanka Bell, DJ Arafat. In the 1980s  Myriam Makeba came to the city, when she was not allowed back to her own country, South Africa, as well as the Congolese diva  Tshala Muana, apostle of the Soukous style of dance.
Since the 1990s Abidjan has had a significant variety of musical styles being exported throughout Africa and the West. These are namely Zoblazo, Mapouka, Zouglou and, since 2002, the Coupé Décalé; the popularity and great variety of these dances make the city a kind of African dance and musical trend capital. Congo-Kinchasa used to be known by this title; with Rumba, Soukous and then Ndombolo.
Abidjan is also considered to be the [reggae] capital of [Africa].
Each year, the city organises the following music [festival]s:
Several fashion events are organised in the city each year: “Les Féeries” (The Fairies), the ceremonies for Miss Côte d'Ivoire, Miss Abidjan District, Miss Christmas (from 6–11 years) and Miss Awoulaba (very prestigious). Moreover, the “Yéhé Fashion Show” takes place every year, a celebration of African fashion, and the “International Festival of Lingerie and Beauty of Abidjan” (FILBA).
Abidjan is also the headquarters for Côte d'Ivoire’s clothes designers, renowned for being the best in Africa; including  Gilles Touré (designer for Miss Côte d'Ivoire) or even Pathéo.
Côte d'Ivoire national sport (basketball, athletics, rugby,  handball, volleyball, etc.), especially football, is very popular in Abidjan. Abidjan is home to the  ASEC Mimosas football club, one of the country’s leading football clubs followed by  Africa Sport National.
Events :
The main football event organised in Abidjan was the 1984  African Cup of Nations and one of the finals of the 1983  African Youth Cup of Nations.
In 1964 the Jeux d’Abidjan took place in Abidjan, as did the final of the  African Cup Winners’ Cup in 1975, 1980, 1983 and 1990, then another in 1992 under the name of  CAF Confederations Cup. The  Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny was the host of the very first  African Super Cup in 1992, and the second in 1998. The finals of the 1966, 1986, 1995 and 1998  CAF Champions League also took place in Abidjan.
The economic capital also attracted other football events such as the  Assumption Tournament (the first one taking place in 2007 in the  Stade Robert Champroux), the West African Club Championship (UFOA Cup), and international gala matches.
Basketball
Rugby
Abidjan is the centre of Ivorian rugby, and most of the  Côte d'Ivoire national rugby union team have come from here. Although the origins of Ivorian rugby go back to the 1960s and earlier, real growth came about when the paid French official Jean-François Turon managed to get the game adopted by  Abidjan University at the turn of the 1980s, but it is François Dali who is seen as the father of Ivorian rugby, and his son was the national captain during the 1990s.

Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria. It is located in the centre of Nigeria, within the  Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Abuja is a  planned city, and was built mainly in the 1980s. It officially became Nigeria's capital on 12 December 1991, replacing Lagos, which is still the country's most populous city. At the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 776,298, making it one of the top ten most populous cities in Nigeria. However, Abuja has witnessed a huge influx of people into the city which has led to the emergence of satellite towns such as  Karu Urban Area,  Suleja, Gwagwalada, Lugbe, Kuje and smaller settlements to which the planned city is sprawling towards, the unofficial metropolitan area of Abuja is well over three million. According to Dermographia, the population Abuja's Urban Area as of 2012 is 2,245,000, making it the fourth largest urban area in Nigeria only suppassed by Lagos, Kano and  Ibadan. while Port Harcourt's urban area which is projected to be almost 2,000,000 is the fifth most populous urban area in Nigeria.
Abuja's geography is defined by  Aso Rock, a 400-metre  monolith left by water erosion. The  Presidential Complex,  National Assembly,  Supreme Court and much of the town extend to the south of the rock.
Other sights include the  Nigerian National Mosque and the  Nigerian National Christian Centre. The city is served by the  Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, while  Zuma Rock lies nearby. Abuja is known for being the best purpose-built city in Africa as well as being one of the wealthiest and most expensive; however, the population on the semi-developed edges of the city are living in rural areas such as  Karu,  Nasarawa State.
In light of the ethnic and religious divisions of Nigeria, plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a location deemed neutral to all parties. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity. Another impetus for Abuja came because of Lagos' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid. The logic used was similar to the way Brazil planned its capital,  Brasília. Construction broke ground and was dedicated in the late 1970s but, due to economic and political instability, the initial stages of the city were not complete until the late 1980s. The master plan for Abuja and the  Federal Capital Territory (FCT) was developed by International Planning Associates (IPA), a consortium of three American firms: Planning Research Corporation;  Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd; and Archisystems, a division of the Hughes Organization. The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are visible in the city's current form. More detailed design of the central areas of the capital, particularly its monumental core, was accomplished by  Kenzo Tange, a renowned Japanese architect, with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company. Most countries relocated their  embassies to Abuja, and many maintain their former embassies as  consulates in Lagos, still the commercial capital of Nigeria. Abuja is the headquarters of the  Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the regional headquarters of  OPEC. Abuja and the FCT have experienced huge population growth; it has been reported that some areas around Abuja have been growing at 20% to 30% per year. Squatter settlements and towns have spread rapidly in and outside the city limits. Tens of thousands of people have been  evicted since former FCT minister  Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai started a demolition campaign in 2003.
The FCT's ministers have been as follows:
The Phase 1 area of the city is divided into ten districts: the
There are also sixteen districts in Phase 2. They are
And the Phase 3 districts are
There are five suburban districts:  Nyanya,  Karu,  Gwagwalada,  Kubwa, and  Jukwoyi. Along the Airport Road are clusters of  satellite settlements, namely  Lugbe,  Chika,  Kuchigworo and  Pyakassa. Other satellite settlements are  Idu (the main  industrial zone),  Mpape,  Karimu,  Gwagwa,  Dei-Dei (housing the International Livestock market and also International Building materials market).
Abuja's Central District is between the foot of  Aso Rock and into the Three Arms Zone to the southern base of the ring road. It is like the city's spinal cord, dividing it into the northern sector with Maitama and Wuse, and the southern sector with Garki and Asokoro. While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and  multinational corporations have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the Three Arms Zone, so called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery,  Eagle Square (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier across the road facing it. The  National Mosque and  National Church of Nigeria are opposite each other on either side of Independence Avenue. A well-known government office is the Ministry of Defense, colloquially nicknamed &quot;Ship House&quot;.
The Garki District is the area in the southwest corner of the city, having the Central District to the north and the Asokoro District to the east. The district is subdivided into units called &quot;Areas&quot;. Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of &quot;Area&quot; to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2. Visitors may find this system confusing.
Garki is presently the principal business district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Maculay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1). A new five-star hotel, Hawthorn Suites Abuja, is in Garki II.
Area 2 is mainly used for residential purposes, although a zoological garden as well as Garki Shopping Centre are in Area 2. Several banks and other commercial offices are located along Moshood Abiola Way in Area 7. The headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces – Army, Airforce and Navy – are all in the Garki District.
The tallest building in this district is the Radio House, which houses the Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, and the  Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN). The  Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are based in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.
The Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja is in Area 10. Other places of note include the Arts and Culture Centre and The Nigerian Police Mobile Force headquarters in Area 10. The Abuja Municipal Area Council, which is the local government administration has its headquarters in Area 10. The new United States Embassy is in the Garki district.
Wuse District is the northwestern part of the city, with the Maitama District to its north and the Central District to its south. The District is numbered Zones 1–8. The Wuse Market is Abuja's principal market (Zone 5). The second most important post office in the city is here. This district houses the Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Zone 4), Ibro International hotel, the Foreign Affairs Ministry Headquarters (Zone 3) and Nigerian Customs Services Headquarters, Federal Civil Service Commission (Zone 3), Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration (NAFDAC) (Zone 7), Wuse General Hospital, and the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation. Just as Garki District has Garki II, Wuse has Wuse II. This is distinct from Wuse Zone 2.
Maitama District is to the north of the city, with the Wuse and Central Districts lying to its southwest and southeast respectively. This area is home to the top bracket sections of society and business, and has the reputation of being very exclusive and very expensive. Interesting buildings include the  Transcorp Hilton Hotel,  National Communications Commission Headquarters (NCC),  National Universities Commission (NUC), Soil Conservation Complex, and  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The British High Commission is located along  Aguiyi Ironsi Way, in Maitama. Also, the Maitama District Hospital is another notable building in Maitama. Maitama District is home to many of the European embassies.
Asokoro District, the  doyen of the districts, houses all of the state's lodges/guest houses. The ECOWAS secretariat is a focal point of interest. Asokoro is to the east of Garki district and south of Central district. It is one of the most exclusive districts of Abuja and houses virtually all of the federal cabinet ministers; in addition, the Presidential Palace (commonly referred to as the Aso Rock) is in Asokoro district. By virtue of this fact, Asokoro is the most secure area of the city.
 Gwarimpa is the last district in the Abuja Municipal Area Council. It is a 20-kilometer drive from the central district and contains the largest single housing estate in Nigeria, the Gwarimpa Housing Estate. The estate was built by the administration of General  Sani Abacha and is the largest of its kind in Africa. It provides residence for the majority of the civil servants in federal ministries and government  parastatals. The ECOWAS Court has an official quarters for the President and Members of the Court in Gwarimpa.
Abuja under  Köppen climate classification features a  tropical wet and dry climate. The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid  rainy season and a blistering  dry season. In between the two, there is a brief interlude of  harmattan occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of  dust haze, intensified coldness and dryness.
The rainy season begins from April and ends in October, when daytime temperatures reach 28 °C (82.4 °F) to 30 °C (86.0 °F) and nighttime lows hover around 22 °C (71.6 °F) to 23 °C (73.4 °F). In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as 40 °C (104.0 °F) and nighttime temperatures can dip to 12 °C (53.6 °F). Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above 30 °C (86.0 °F). The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory.
Rainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the  Jos Plateau and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from March to November every year. 
The FCT falls within the  Guinean forest-savanna mosaic zone of the West African sub-region. Patches of rain forest, however, occur in the  Gwagwa plains, especially in the rugged terrain to the south southeastern parts of the territory, where a landscape of gullies and rough terrain is found. These areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) form one of the few surviving occurrences of the mature forest vegetation in Nigeria.
The Abuja skyline is made up of mostly mid-range and a few tall buildings. Only recently have tall buildings begun to appear. Most of the buildings are modern, reflecting that it is a new city.
Plans have been made to build  skyscrapers such as the  Millennium Tower which is currently under construction. When finished, this structure will loom 170 meters above the city. The tower will be part of a huge cultural development complex called the Nigeria National Complex including the Nigeria Cultural Centre, a 120.000 m2 structure dedicated to the art and culture of Nigeria. The Cultural Centre and the Millennium Tower have been designed by the Italian architect  Manfredi Nicoletti.
Landmarks include the  Millennium Tower (which is currently under construction), the  Central Bank of Nigeria headquarters, the  Nigerian Presidential Complex, the Ship House, the  National Stadium,  National Mosque the  Christian Centre, the  Castle of Law,  Aso Rock and  Zuma Rock
 Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport is the main airport serving Abuja and the surrounding capital region. It was named after Nigeria's first president, Dr.  Nnamdi Azikiwe. The airport has international and domestic terminals.
Due to the slow pace of road reconstruction, inhabitants of Abuja face hours on hours in traffic trying to get to work each day. About 75 percent of residents reside in the outskirts of the main city where all economic activities are located. People coming from Kubwa and environs spend 1 hour due to ongoing construction across the city.
Abuja is home to several parks and green areas with the largest one being  Millennium Park. Millennium Park was designed by world renowned architect  Manfredi Nicoletti and was officially opened by the United Kingdom's Elizabeth II in December 2003.

Accra  / ə ˈ k r ɑː / is the capital and largest city of Ghana, with an estimated urban population of 2,291,352 as of 2012. Accra is also the capital of the  Greater Accra Region and of the  Accra Metropolitan District, with which it is coterminous. Accra is furthermore the anchor of a larger  metropolitan area, the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), which is home to about 4 million people, making it the largest metropolitan conglomeration in Ghana by population, and the  eleventh-largest metropolitan area in Africa.
Accra stretches along the Ghanaian Atlantic coast and extends north into the country's interior. Originally built around a port, it served as the capital of the British-ruled  Gold Coast between 1877 and 1957. Once merely a 19th-century suburb of  Victoriaborg, Accra has since transitioned into a modern metropolis; the city's architecture reflects this history, ranging from 19th-century British  colonial buildings to modern  skyscrapers and apartment blocks.
Accra is Ghana's  primate city, serving as the nation's economic and administrative hub. It is furthermore a centre of culture and tourism, sporting a wide range of nightclubs, restaurants and hotels. Since the early 1990s, a number of new buildings have been built, including the multi-storey French-owned  Novotel hotel. The city's  National Theatre was built with Chinese assistance. In 2010, the  GaWC designated Accra a  Gamma-minus-level  world city, indicating a growing level of international influence and connectedness.
The  central business district of Accra contains the city's main banks and department stores, the Cocoa Marketing Board headquarters (dealing with cocoa, Ghana's chief export), and an area known as the Ministries, where  Ghana's government administration is concentrated. Economic activities in Accra include the financial and agricultural sectors, Atlantic fishing, and the manufacture of processed food, lumber,  plywood, textiles, clothing and chemicals.
The word Accra is believed to be derived from the  Akan word nkran, meaning &quot;ants&quot;, a reference to the numerous  anthills seen in the countryside around Accra. The city was first settled in the 15th century, when the  Ga people migrated there from their previous settlement at  Ayawaso, 10 miles (16 km) north of Accra. The site was advantageous due to its distance from the Ga's main rivals, the  Akwamu people. Initially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at Ada and Prampram, along with the inland centres of Dodowa and Akusa. However, Accra gained status as a centre for the slave trade with the Europeans who had built the nearby outposts of James Fort and  Ussher Fort. By the 17th century, the Portuguese, followed by the Swedish, Dutch, French, British and Danish, had constructed forts in the town. Such activity went on in Accra until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807.
In the 1850s, Denmark sold  Christiansborg and their other forts to the British. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and the  Asante people of central Ghana, the British attacked and virtually destroyed the Asante capital of Kumasi, and officially declared Ghana a crown colony. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second  Anglo-Asante War, Accra replaced Cape Coast as the capital of the British  Gold Coast colony. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast, and was not home to the tsetse fly, thus allowing the use of animal transport. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the Korle Lagoon to the west.
As the colony's administrative functions were moved to Accra, an influx of British colonists began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents.  Victoriaborg was formed in the late nineteenth century as an exclusive European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908, following an outbreak of the  bubonic plague. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre.  Adabraka was thus established to the north of the city centre to serve as an enclave for the town's  Muslim population.
One of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main cocoa-producing regions. In 1923 the railway was completed, and by 1924 cocoa was Ghana's largest export. Accra was the main exporter of cocoa until 1928; this was one of the main reasons for its rapid growth.
The British government heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example,  racial segregation of neighborhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete. Despite these regulations, the British government was very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of  Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg.
Among the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of  hospitals and schools. Such improvements led to an increase in Accra’s population due to the  migration of rural dwellers into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.
In the years following World War II, the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima or Accra New Town. Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled  shanty-town landscape.
Another area of Accra that took shape at this time was the  central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.
In 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.
In the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganisation of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. In order to reorganise the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.
To the east of this newly organised CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad open space for a restaurant, country club, and  polo and cricket fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighbourhood of  Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the British colonial rule in Ghana ended before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.
When  Kwame Nkrumah became Ghana's first post-independence  Prime Minister in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development. Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout Africa.
Rather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention away from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance. The Nkrumah plan did not emphasize order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.
The modern city is centred around the original  Ga town, as well as the British, Danish and Dutch forts and their surrounding communities:  Jamestown near the British  James Fort,  Osu near the Danish fort of  Christiansborg (now  Osu Castle), and  Ussherstown near the Dutch  Ussher fort.
Today, Accra has several major tourist attractions, including the National Museum of Ghana, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Archives of Ghana and Ghana's central library, the National Theatre, the Accra Centre for National Culture, a  lighthouse, and the National Sports Stadium.
The city is also a major transportation hub, home to the  Kotoka International Airport and railway links to  Tema,  Takoradi and Kumasi. Accra has furthermore become a popular location for national and international business conferences.
 Accommodation in Ghana
Central Accra is compact, centered around the historical British, Danish, and Dutch forts. Over the years, however, with immigration from rural areas, the city has expanded with no regard to zoning, giving it a sprawled attribute. The city of Accra has a total area of 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi), and is the anchor city of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), which is made up of the Accra Metropolitan District, Tema Metropolitan District, Ga South Municipal District, Ga East Municipal District, Ga West Municipal District, Adenta Municipal District, Ashaiman Municipal District, Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal District, and the town of Kasoa in the Awutu Senya District of the  Central Region.
The intersection of the Lafa stream and Mallam junction serves as the western border of the city. The Great Hall of the  University of Ghana forms Accra's northern border, while the Nautical College forms the eastern border. The Gulf of Guinea forms the southern border. These borders notwithstanding, points of conflict with adjoining districts exist, resulting in a de facto shrinking of the city limits in recent years.
The growth of Accra in recent decades due to  immigration from the Diaspora of the Americas, European, Asian, including African nationals and other nationals from all over the world, has outstripped the provision of services such as waste collection, potable water and electricity. Because of immigration there has been a rise of large  slums. Accra currently has 9 slums. All nine Slums settlements, and the so-called &quot; Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; shanty towns, are being demolished because of their negative effect on the environment.
The Ring Road, extending from the Korle Lagoon in the west, north to Kwame Nkrumah Circle, following east to the juncture of Independence Avenue, and continuing on to  Osu, forms a ring around the oldest districts of Accra, and separates central Accra from the outlying suburbs.
Central Accra includes the CBD, which consists of the historic districts of  Usshertown, Tudu,  Victoriaborg,  West Ridge, and  East Ridge, as well as the historic residential districts of  Jamestown,  Adabraka, Asylum Down,  North Ridge and  Christiansborg/Osu.
Although satellite business districts such as the Airport City have been established across the city, Central Accra remains the administrative and cultural centre of Accra, hosting the nation's government ministries, hotels and businesses, along with the headquarters of many of Ghana's major financial institutions.
Central Accra's principal attractions include the  Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum, the National Museum,  Independence Square, the  National Theatre, and the  Ohene Djan Stadium.
Northern Accra is a major residential and business district. The area also contains important landmarks such as the &quot;37&quot; Military Hospital,  Golden Jubilee House, several important foreign  embassies,  Achimota School, Achimota Golf Park, and the  University of Ghana's Legon campus, which serves as the city's northern boundary.
Geographically, for the purposes of this article, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, and west of Liberation Road will be regarded as Northern Accra. The districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway will also be included in this classification.
Eastern Accra is largely residential, and geographically north of Ring Road East, stretching as far north as Kwame Nkrumah Motorway; the district is bordered to the west by Liberation Road.
Western Accra is largely a residential and business area. Whilst geographically less expansive than the northern and eastern reaches of the city as a result of the large saltponds of Tettegu and Aplaku, it nonetheless boasts one of Accra's most important landmarks, the  Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.
Geographically, the areas west of Ring Road West, extending as far west as the saltponds and south of Graphic Road, are considered Accra West.
Owing to its location in the  Dahomey Gap, where the coast runs parallel to the prevailing moist monsoonal winds, Accra features a  tropical savanna climate that borders on a  semi-arid climate. The average annual rainfall is about 730 mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and give rise to local flooding where drainage channels are obstructed.
There is very little variation in temperature throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from 24.7 °C (76.5 °F) in August (the coolest) to 28 °C (82.4 °F) in March (the hottest), with an annual average of 26.8 °C (80.2 °F). It should be noted, however, that the &quot;cooler&quot; months tend to be more  humid than the warmer months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy  harmattan season, the city experiences a breezy &quot;dry heat&quot; that feels less warm than the &quot;cooler&quot; but more humid rainy season.
As Accra is close to the equator, the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year. Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the mid-afternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 to 16 km/h. High wind gusts occur with thunderstorms, which generally pass in  squall along the coast.
The maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4 km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience micro-climatic effects. Low-profile  drainage basins with a north-south orientation are not as well ventilated as those orientated east-west.
Air is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.
With an estimated population of about 3.9 million, Accra is today one of  the largest and fastest-growing cities in Africa, with an annual growth rate of 3.36%.
The period between 1960 and 1970 saw rapid industrialisation and expansion in Accra's manufacturing and commercial sectors. This contributed to high  rural-urban migration from west African nationals to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.
The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra’s population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970-1984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the  service sector, once again propelled immigration to Accra.
The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as Ghana's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its rapid population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the city's population growth.
The gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare.
At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, James Town and Ussher Town. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.
Accra’s population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.
Decentralisation, and birth control policies are expected to reduce both the natural birth and migration rates in Accra. However, the city's infrastructure and economic growth will for a long time make it a more attractive place for public servants and national and international investors.
An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and sex, reveals that 44% of residents in Accra are west African migrants from neighbouring countries. This reflects the cosmopolitan nature attractiveness of the metropolis.
Parts of inner-city Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-utilised service infrastructure on the one hand, and indigenous, low-class, and high-density development with depressed conditions and overstretched infrastructure services on the other.
The rapid growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old indigenous settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners mostly found there.
The result is that the older indigenous areas of Accra, such as Ga Mashie, are experiencing decay. Calls are being made for proactive efforts of inner city revitalisation to address this issue.
Peripheral residential development in Accra is usually haphazard, with barely sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds.
Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing zones may be divided into indigenous and non-indigenous (dominantly immigrant) areas. The low-income indigenous housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie and Nungua.
The low-income non-indigenous housing areas include Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra’s total population of which are the west African. Most of the city's informal businesses are located in low-income areas, which are the first place of abode for any new job-seeking immigrant.
Almost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the indigenous areas of the inner city. Conditions are generally depressed, with poor supporting social and engineering infrastructure.
Buildings are of poor-quality material, often using mud, untreated timber and zinc roofing sheets for walling. The housing environment is characterised by haphazard development, inadequate housing infrastructure, poor drainage.
The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens, Lebanese, European, and Asian business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and private sector organisations and individuals.
The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens, Lebanese, Europeans, and Asians make up.
The high-income areas provide housing for the remaining 10% of the population of which Ghanaian citizens, Lebanese, Europeans, and Asians also make up. They include areas like North and West Ridge, Ringway Estates, north Labone Estates, Airport Residential Area, Roman Ridge, East Legon. These areas are all planned and have well developed infrastructure with spacious and landscaped ground in sharp contrast with, particularly, the low-income areas. Buildings are usually built with  sandcrete blocks, and have walls and roofed with aluminium, or  asbestos roofing sheets.
There are also high-income peripheral areas like Haatso, Kwabenya, Pokuase, Adenta, Taifa, Mallam, where development of engineering infrastructure is not yet complete. These areas developed ahead of infrastructure, however the Achimota-Ofankor motorway is scheduled to open in May 2012, and the  Awoshie-Pokuase dual carriageway is now under construction. Building materials used are similar to those in the middle and high-income zones.
In total, 84.4% of all houses in the Accra Metropolitan Area have their outside walls made up of  cement, as compared to 63.3% for other Ghanaian urban areas, and 44.8% for the nation in general. Similarly, houses found within Accra have 99.2% of their floor materials made up of cement, while the figures for other urban areas and the nation are 95.1% and 84.7% respectively. It can therefore be inferred that, although in some instances low-income areas have exhibited poor housing conditions, the general quality of housing in Accra is significantly better than that of other urban areas and Ghanaian housing in general.
Accra has a mayoral council government system in which the  mayor is vested with extensive executive powers. The mayor is appointed by the  President of the Republic of Ghana and approved by the city council, although the public has expressed a desire to increase mayoral accountability by holding free mayoral elections. The current mayor of Accra is  Alfred Vanderpuije, appointed by President  John Atta Mills in 2009.
The Accra Assembly has a total of 104 members. Of these, 70% are elected and 30% are government appointees. The Town and Country Planning Department is responsible for land-use planning in the metropolis.
As the capital of Ghana, Accra is the home of the national administration, including the Ministries and  Parliament. Accra also serves as the home of the  Supreme Court of Ghana, and is the headquarters of the  Bank of Ghana.
Due to its size, Accra is divided into 11 sub-metropolitan areas:
In 2008, the  World Bank estimated that Accra's economy constituted around 10% of Ghana's total gross domestic product (GDP), or around US$3 billion. The economically active population of Accra is estimated to be 823,327, but the daily influx of  commuters from  dormitory towns outside the city inflates this figure on most days.
Accra is a major centre for manufacturing, marketing, finance, insurance, transportation and tourism. It has around 350 major industrial establishments, with Lebanese and Asian companies predominant in business and the economy. Its financial sector incorporates a central bank, nine commercial banks (with 81 branches), four development banks (with 19 branches), four merchant banks (with seven branches), three discount houses, one home finance mortgage bank, multiple  building societies,  Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and  GSE All-Share Index, 218  foreign exchange bureaux, nine finance houses, nine insurance companies, 12 insurance brokerage firms, two savings and loans companies, and numerous  real estate developers. Lebanese, European and Asian companies predominantly own land in the capital, with significant industrial sites and residential developments. They also dominate the importation of goods and services.
The road network in the Accra Metropolitan Area totals 1,117 kilometres (694 mi) in length, consisting of 918 kilometres (570 mi) of paved and 199 kilometres (124 mi) of unpaved roads.
There are over 50,506 identified residential properties in Accra, and about 4,054 commercial/industrial/mixed properties, with a total rateable value of GH¢13,849,014. There are also 29 markets, 36 facilities for both on–street and off-street parking, and over 120,000 units of wholesale, retail and other self-employed businesses, as well as several facilities for sports and recreation, and many tourist centres.
The sectors of Accra's economy consist of the primary (farming, fishing, mining and quarrying), secondary (manufacturing, electricity, gas, water, construction) and tertiary sectors (wholesale trade, retail trade, hotel, restaurant, transportation, storage, communication, financial intermediation, real estate service, public administration, education, health and other social services). The tertiary service sector is the city's largest, employing about 531,670 people. The second-largest, the secondary sector, employs 22.34% of the labor force, or around 183,934 people. 12.2% of the city's workforce are reportedly unemployed, totalling around 114,198 people.
Accra's smallest economic sector, the primary sector, employs approximately 91,556 people. The predominant economic activities are fishing and  urban agriculture, with fishing accounting for 77.8% of production labour.
Farming is practised mostly by families, often without the benefits of modern methods of production. Farming in Accra centres around the growth of vegetables such as  okro, garden eggs,  tomatoes, carrots,  cucumbers, cabbage,  cauliflower, and lettuce. The volume of production of these crops is negligible and declining. The increasing land value in Accra is resulting in urban agricultural land being converted to commercial and economic purposes.
Poultry production is constrained by the high cost of feed. The metropolis has a number of domestic animals, mostly sheep and goats, which depend on the area's natural vegetation for feed. However, large quantities of meat and various dairy products are imported from neighbouring countries and abroad to supplement local production.
The fishing industry is the most important sub-sector, with 10% of the catch being exported and the rest consumed locally. The main types of fish caught include  redfish, red bullet,  herring, sardines, tuna,  yellowfish and  grouper. There are also significant quantities of  shrimp, lobsters and  sole caught. The industry is characterized by extreme seasonableness, operating primarily between June and September, especially in the case of herring and sardine fishing. As a result of Accra's lack of modern refrigerate storage facilities, prices tend to drop during the peak fishing season, resulting in the under-utilization of fishing resources. The bulk of the marine catch during the fishing season is caught by small  canoe fishermen, who have little or no link with credit institutions to support the expansion of their businesses.
Although most deep-water Atlantic fishing around Accra takes place in the June–September period, fishing operations take place close to the shore throughout the year, and there are clear indications of the  depletion of fish stocks in the near future. Fishing operations are most prominent at the Jamestown, La, Teshie, Nungua and Chorkor fishing shores.
Pre-school comprises nursery and kindergarten. In 2001, there was 7,923 children (3,893 girls and 4,030 boys) in  pre-schools in Accra. In 2010, the enrollment rate at Pre-school was 98%. Pre-schools are regulated by the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare, and are mostly privately owned and operated. In 2001, there were 62 government-owned pre-schools in the Accra metropolis.
Primary school enrollment of girls is higher than that of boys. In 2010, the enrollment rate at primary school level was 95%.
The Junior High School is part of Ghana's basic education program. Its nationwide implementation began on 29 September 1987.
In the 2001/2002 academic year, 61,080 pupils had enrolled in Accra, representing 57.17% of the 129,467 school-age 12–to-14-year-olds. In 2010, the enrollment rate at Junior high school level was 95%. The ratio of girls is also higher at this level.
The transition rate between junior high and senior high school increased from 30 per cent in 1990 to 50 per cent in 2001. The number of students grew by 23,102 between 1990 and 2005, an increase of about 2,310 a year, since 2010 the senior high school enrollment rate has been 95%.
Ghana International School (GIS), a private non-profit  A-Level school founded in 1955 for children from ages 3–18, is located in Accra's Cantonments. Abelemkpe is the home of  Lincoln Community School, a private, non-profit  International Baccalaureate (IB) school for students aged 3–18, established in 1968. The  American International School is also situated in Accra.
A number of notable public secondary schools lie on the outskirts of Accra:  Achimota Secondary School, commonly referred to as &quot;Motown&quot;, which was founded in 1924 and opened in 1927; the  Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School, commonly known as &quot;Presec&quot;; Aburi Girls Secondary School, popularly known as &quot;Abugiss&quot; and one of the most well-known girls' boarding schools in Ghana;  St Thomas Aquinas Secondary School, commonly known as &quot;Quinas&quot;; the  Accra Academy, known as &quot;Accra Aca&quot;;  Accra High School commonly known as (&quot;Ahisco&quot;);, West Africa Secondary School, commonly known as &quot;WASS&quot;; the Accra Girls' School, commonly known as &quot;Agiss&quot;; Kaneshie Secondary Technical School (&quot;Kateco&quot;); the Armed Forces Secondary Technical; St. John's  Grammar School; Action Senior High &amp; Technical School (&quot;Action&quot;); and the City Secondary and Business College (&quot;Cibusco&quot;), among others.
Ghana's first  tertiary education institution, the  University of Ghana, is located 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) north of the city centre at  Legon. A number of other public and private universities and tertiary institutions have since been founded in Accra, some of which are listed below.
 Kotoka International Airport (KIA)
Accra is served by  Kotoka International Airport, which has both civil and military uses. Located 6 miles (9.7 kilometres) from downtown Accra, the airport handles all of the city's  scheduled passenger services. Accra is furthermore the hub of two of Ghana's three main railway lines: those to Kumasi and  Takoradi.
Downtown Accra's streets were not organised in a  grid plan, but rather created as needed. By contrast, the streets of planned housing estates, such as Dansoman Estates, Ringway Estates and Kanda Estates, do follow a grid system.
With Ghana having only 21 passenger automobiles per 1,000 citizens as of 2009, public transportation is the most popular means of getting around Accra. Rail services to  Tema, Takoradi and Kumasi are unreliable and unpopular owing to their limited reach.
Feasibility studies for a $1.5 billion  monorail project are to be completed in 2011, to be followed by the construction of rail tracks within the following five years. The privately funded project is to be undertaken by the American Intercontinental Development Corporation (IDC).
Accra has an extensive  taxi network and numerous  taxi ranks, but most taxis lack a meter system, so price negotiation is required between the passenger and driver. Metered taxis do operate in the city, but tend to be more expensive. Taxis in Ghana are painted in two colours: the four bumpers  fenders are yellow/orange, and the rest of the car is in a colour of the operator's choice.
By far the most common form of transport in Accra,  trotros (motor vehicles repurposed for passenger transport) are the biggest, most efficient and cost-effective way of getting around the city. The buses are typically minibuses or vans, with the most popular being Nissan Urvan 15-seaters and Mercedes Benz Sprinter or D 309 vans. Trotros are typically decorated with flags and stickers of various countries or (local and international) soccer teams, and with witty sayings, wisecracks, local proverbs (in English or local languages) or Bible verses printed on the bus's rear. Trotros stop at any bus stop or gathering of people, and can also be found at truck and taxi stations, such as the Neoplan station. The word Trotro may have been derived from the Ga (Gà) word &quot;tro&quot; meaning &quot;pesewa&quot; (the smallest unit of Ghanaian currency), given the trotro's status as a cheap means of transportation.
In 2003, the  Metro Mass Transit Service, was inaugurated in Accra as a more comfortable and cheaper alternative to the trotro. However, the services of these buses have not been highly used. Recently, plans have been afoot to develop a more advanced rapid transit bus system for the city and its metropolitan area. This project is aimed at creating an &quot;integrated, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable transportation system responsive to the needs of society, supporting growth and poverty reduction&quot;.
Football is the most popular sport in Accra, as in the rest of the country. The most famous football club in the city is  Accra Hearts of Oak, whose main rivals are  Asante Kotoko of Kumasi. The Accra Sports Stadium is home to the Hearts of Oak and the regular pitch of the  Black Stars, the national football team. In 2008, the stadium hosted 9 matches in the  2008 African Cup of Nations.
Accra is Ghana's cultural and tourist hub, sporting a wide variety of hotels, monuments, museums and nightclubs. The city has three  five-star hotels: the Labadi Beach Hotel, the La Palm Royal Beach Hotel and the Movenpick Ambassador Hotel. The Golden Tulip Hotel and Novotel Accra, located in Accra's  central business district, are both ranked four stars. There are numerous three-star hotels, including the Hotel Wangara, Hotel Shangri-La and Erata Hotel, as well as many budget hotels. The  Accra International Conference Centre and other meeting facilities provide venues for conference tourism, an area in which Ghana leads the rest of the West African sub-region.
Accra furthermore hosts the  National Museum, which houses a large collection of Ghanaian historical treasures; the  National Theatre, with its distinctive modern  Chinese architecture; and the National Cultural Centre, whose arts and crafts  bazaar and traditional textile market host traditional handicrafts from all over Ghana.
The Du Bois Centre houses a research library and gallery of manuscripts, as well as the graves of its namesake, the  African-American scholar  W.E.B. Du Bois, and his wife  Shirley Graham Du Bois. The  Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum is the resting place of Ghana’s first President,  Kwame Nkrumah, who oversaw the country's independence from British rule and was a leading exponent of  Pan-Africanism.
The city's foremost historical site is the Jamestown area, which contains the national monuments of  Ussher Fort and  James Fort, and  Osu Castle (also known as  Christiansborg), built by Danish settlers in the 17th century.
Accra is well known for its Atlantic beachfront. The most popular of the city's beaches is Labadi Beach, along with Kokrobite Beach, which is located 25 kilometres west of Accra. The beachfront area also houses the Academy of African Music and Arts.
Other sites of note include  Golden Jubilee House (the new residence and office of the  President of Ghana), the Accra Centre for National Culture, the  Accra Sports Stadium, Independence Square, the  Parliament of Ghana, and the  Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT.
The Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is the seat of the  Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Accra, which was founded in 1943 as the  Apostolic Prefecture of Accra. The cathedral itself dates to 1947.

Angkor Wat (or Angkor Vat) is a  temple at Angkor, Cambodia, built for King  Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as his state temple and capital city. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation—first  Hindu, dedicated to Vishnu, then Buddhist. The temple is the epitome of the high classical style of  Khmer  architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its  national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.
Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the  temple mountain and the later  galleried temple. It is designed to represent  Mount Meru, home of the  devas in Hindu mythology: within a  moat and an outer wall 3.6 km (2.2 miles) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a  quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive  bas-reliefs and for the numerous  devatas (guardian spirits) adorning its walls.
The modern name, Angkor Wat, in use by the 16th century, means &quot;City Temple&quot;: Angkor is a vernacular form of the word nokor which comes from the Sanskrit word nagara (capital), while  wat is the  Khmer word for temple. Prior to this time the temple was known as Preah Pisnulok, after the posthumous title of its founder,  Suryavarman II.
Angkor Wat lies 5.5 km north of the modern town of  Siem Reap, and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred on the  Baphuon. It is in an area of Cambodia where there is an important group of ancient structures. It is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites.
The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of  Suryavarman II (ruled 1113 – c. 1150), Dedicated to Vishnu, it was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation  stela nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as Vrah Vishnulok after the presiding deity. Work seems to have ended on the king's death, leaving some of the  bas-relief decoration unfinished.In 1177 Angkor was sacked by the  Chams, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. Thereafter the  empire was restored by a new king,  Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital and state temple ( Angkor Thom and the  Bayon respectively) a few kilometres to the north.
In the 14th or 15th century the temple was converted to  Theravada Buddhist use, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned, its preservation being due in part to the fact that its moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle.
One of the first  Western visitors to the temple was  Antonio da Magdalena, a Portuguese monk who visited in 1586 and said that it &quot;is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of&quot;. However, the temple was popularised in the West only in the mid-19th century on the publication of  Henri Mouhot's travel notes. The French explorer wrote of it:
&quot;One of these temples—a rival to that of  Solomon, and erected by some ancient Michelangelo—might take an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings. It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome, and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.&quot;
Mouhot, like other early Western visitors, was unable to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple, and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together only from stylistic and  epigraphic evidence accumulated during the subsequent clearing and restoration work carried out across the whole Angkor site.
Angkor Wat required considerable restoration in the 20th century, mainly the removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the civil war and  Khmer Rouge control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period other than the theft and destruction of mostly post-Angkorian statues.
The temple has become a symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of every  Cambodian national flag since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. In  January 2003 riots erupted in  Phnom Penh when a false rumour circulated that a Thai soap opera actress had claimed that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand.
Angkor Wat, located at  13°24′45″N 103°52′0″E, is a unique combination of the  temple mountain, the standard design for the empire's state temples, the later plan of concentric  galleries, and influences from  Orissa and the Chola of  Tamil Nadu, India. The temple is a representation of  Mount Meru, the home of the gods: the central  quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.
Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including Glaize and  George Coedès) to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple. Further evidence for this view is provided by the  bas-reliefs, which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction— prasavya in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services. The archaeologist  Charles Higham also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower. Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of Angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to Vishnu, who was associated with the west.
A further interpretation of Angkor Wat has been proposed by  Eleanor Mannikka. Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, she argues that these indicate a claimed new era of peace under king  Suryavarman II: &quot;as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above.&quot; Mannikka's suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles. She distances herself from the speculations of others, such as  Graham Hancock, that Angkor Wat is part of a representation of the constellation  Draco.
Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of  Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of  sandstone (rather than  brick or  laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural  resins or  slaked lime have been suggested.
Angkor Wat has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design, which has been compared to the architecture of ancient Greece or Rome. According to  Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple &quot;attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style.&quot;
Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the  ogival, redented towers shaped like  lotus buds; half- galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are  devatas (or apsaras),  bas-reliefs, and on  pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including  gilded  stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.
The Angkor Wat style was followed by that of the  Bayon period, in which quality was often sacrificed to quantity. Other temples in the style are  Banteay Samré,  Thommanon,  Chao Say Tevoda and the early temples of  Preah Pithu at Angkor; outside Angkor,  Beng Mealea and parts of  Phanom Rung and  Phimai.
The outer wall, 1024 by 802 m and 4.5 m high, is surrounded by a 30 m apron of open ground and a moat 190 m wide. Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge. There are  gopuras at each of the  cardinal points; the western is much the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper. Under the southern tower is a statue of Vishnu, known as Ta Reach, which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine. Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as &quot;elephant gates&quot;, as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with  lotus rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and  devatas, including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.
The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets. Most of the area is now covered by forest. A 350 m causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with  naga balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a  library with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.
The temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular  galleries rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king,  Brahma, the moon, and Vishnu. Each gallery has a  gopura at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a  quincunx with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.
The outer gallery measures 187 by 215 m, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called Preah Poan (the &quot;Hall of a Thousand Buddhas&quot;). Buddha images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in  Khmer but others in  Burmese and  Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water. North and south of the cloister are  libraries.
Beyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards,  devatas abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is 100 by 115 m, and may originally have been flooded to represent the ocean around  Mount Meru. Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods. This inner gallery, called the Bakan, is a 60 m square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or  garudas. Carved  lintels and pediments decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines. The tower above the central shrine rises 43 m to a height of 65 m above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four. The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to  Theravada Buddhism, the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of  gold leaf two metres above ground level.
Integrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of  bas-relief friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Higham has called these, &quot;the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving&quot;. From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which Rama defeats  Ravana) and the  Battle of Kurukshetra (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the  Kaurava and  Pandava clans). On the southern gallery follow the only historical scene, a procession of  Suryavarman II, then the 32  hells and 37  heavens of Hindu mythology. Glaize writes of;
&quot;... those unfortunate souls who are to be thrown down to hell to suffer a refined cruelty which, at times, seems to be a little disproportionate to the severity of the crimes committed. So it is that people who have damaged others' property have their bones broken, that the glutton is cleaved in two, that rice thieves are afflicted with enormous bellies of hot iron, that those who picked the flowers in the garden of Shiva have their heads pierced with nails, and thieves are exposed to cold discomfort.&quot;
On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the  Churning of the Sea of Milk, showing 92  asuras and 88  devas using the serpent  Vasuki to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the  winter solstice to the  spring equinox, and from the equinox to the summer  solstice). It is followed by Vishnu defeating  asuras (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over  Bana (where according to Glaize, &quot;The workmanship is at its worst&quot;) and a battle between the Hindu gods and asuras. The north-west and south-west corner pavilions both feature much smaller-scale scenes, some unidentified but most from the Ramayana or the life of  Krishna.
Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has seen a resumption of conservation efforts and a massive increase in tourism. The temple is part of the Angkor World Heritage Site, established in 1992, which has provided some funding and has encouraged the Cambodian government to protect the site. The  German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the  devatas and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005.  World Monuments Fund began work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008.
Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination. In 2004 and 2005, government figures suggest that, respectively, 561,000 and 677,000 foreign visitors arrived in Siem Reap province, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia for both years. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some  graffiti; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole Angkor site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by foreign government-sponsored teams rather than by the Cambodian authorities.

Architecture (Latin  architectura, from the Greek  ἀρχιτέκτων – arkhitekton, from  ἀρχι- &quot;chief&quot; and  τέκτων &quot;builder, carpenter, mason&quot;) is both the process and product of  planning,  designing and  construction. Architectural works, in the material form of  buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as  works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
&quot;Architecture&quot; can mean:
In relation to buildings, architecture has to do with the planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience that reflect functional, technical, social, environmental, and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of material, technology, light and shadow. Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimating and construction administration. As documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, architecture defines the  structure and/or  behaviour of a building or any other kind of  system that is to be or has been constructed.
The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is  De architectura, by the Roman architect  Vitruvius in the early 1st century AD. According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitas, utilitas, venustas, which translate roughly as –
According to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible.  Leone Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise,  De Re Aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of  Vasari. The treatises, by the 18th century, had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish and English.
In the early nineteenth century,  Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin wrote Contrasts (1836) that, as the titled suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world.  Gothic architecture, Pugin believed, was the only &quot;true Christian form of architecture.&quot;
The 19th century English art critic,  John Ruskin, in his Seven Lamps of Architecture, published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the &quot;art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them&quot; contributes &quot;to his mental health, power, and pleasure&quot;.
For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way &quot;adorned&quot;. For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned, functional building needed string  courses or  rustication, at the very least.
On the difference between the ideals of &quot;architecture&quot; and mere &quot; construction&quot;, the renowned 20th C. architect  Le Corbusier wrote: &quot;You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: This is beautiful. That is Architecture&quot;.
By contrast, le Corbusier's contemporary,  Ludwig Mies van der Rohe said that architecture begins &quot;when 2 bricks are put together.&quot;
The great 19th century architect of skyscrapers,  Louis Sullivan, promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: &quot; Form follows function&quot;.
While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of &quot;function&quot; in place of Vitruvius' &quot;utility&quot;. &quot;Function&quot; came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a  building, not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural.
Nunzia Rondanini stated, &quot;Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing  values, architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.'
To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality&quot;.
Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are  rationalism, empiricism,  structuralism,  poststructuralism, and  phenomenology.
In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of  sustainability. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management and  lighting.
Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available  building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a  craft, and &quot;architecture&quot; is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft.
It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed  vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day. Early human settlements were mostly  rural. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating  urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of  Çatal Höyük in  Anatolia and  Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan.
In many ancient civilizations, such as those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the  supernatural, and many ancient cultures resorted to monumentality in architecture to represent symbolically the political power of the ruler, the ruling elite, or the state itself.
The architecture and  urbanism of the  Classical civilizations such as the Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural &quot;style&quot; developed in the form of the  Classical orders.
Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. These texts provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons. Some examples of canons are found in the writings of the 1st-century BCE Roman military engineer  Vitruvius. Some of the most important early examples of canonic architecture are religious.
Early Asian writings on architecture include the Kao Gong Ji of China from the 7th–5th centuries BCE; the  Vaastu Shastra of ancient India and  Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra of Sri Lanka.
The architecture of different parts of Asia developed along different lines from that of Europe; Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity. In many Asian countries a pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the  natural landscape.
Islamic architecture began in the 7th century  CE, incorporating architectural forms from the ancient Middle East and  Byzantium, but also developing features to suit the religious and social needs of the society. Examples can be found throughout the Middle East, North Africa, Spain and the Indian Sub-continent. The widespread application of the pointed arch was to influence European architecture of the Medieval period.
In Europe, in both the  Classical and Medieval periods, buildings were not often attributed to specific individuals and the names of architects remain frequently unknown, despite the vast scale of the many religious buildings extant from this period.
During the Medieval period guilds were formed by craftsmen to organize their trade and written contracts have survived, particularly in relation to ecclesiastical buildings. The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, or Magister lathomorum as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents.
In Renaissance Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of  Renaissance Humanism which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects –  Brunelleschi,  Alberti, Michelangelo,  Palladio – and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between  artist,  architect and  engineer, or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference.
A revival of the Classical style in architecture was accompanied by a burgeoning of science and engineering which affected the proportions and structure of buildings. At this stage, it was still possible for an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations involved was within the scope of the generalist.
With the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology, architecture and engineering began to separate, and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects, often at the expense of technical aspects of building design. There was also the rise of the &quot;gentleman architect&quot; who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes, typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the  Neo Gothic or  Scottish Baronial styles. Formal architectural training in the 19th century, for example at  Ecole des Beaux Arts in France, gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility. Effective architects generally received their training in the offices of other architects, graduating to the role from draughtsmen or clerks.
Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption. Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products, once within the province of expensive craftsmanship, became cheaper under machine production.
 Vernacular architecture became increasingly ornamental. House builders could use current architectural design in their work by combining features found in pattern books and architectural journals.
Around the turn of the 20th century, a general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture. Notable among these is the  Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the  Bauhaus school, founded in  Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis—the apex—of art, craft, and technology.
When  Modern architecture was first practiced, it was an  avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favour of functionalist details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms.
Architects such as  Frank Lloyd Wright developed  Organic architecture in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being  Robie House and  Falling Water.
Architects such as  Mies van der Rohe,  Philip Johnson and  Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the  International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Centre.
Many architects resisted Modernism, finding it devoid of the decorative richness of ornamented styles and as the founders of that movement lost influence in the late 1970s,  Postmodernism developed as a reaction against its austerity. Postmodernism viewed Modernism as being too extreme and even harsh in regards to design. Instead, Postmodernists combined Modernism with older styles from before the 1900s to form a middle ground.  Robert Venturi's contention that a &quot;decorated shed&quot; (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside) was better than a &quot;duck&quot; (an ungainly building in which the whole form and its function are tied together) gives an idea of these approaches.
Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect  from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability. The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many.  Modernism and  Postmodernism, have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession, such as  Christopher Alexander, who felt that successful architecture was not a personal philosophical or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it had to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioural, environmental, and social sciences.
Environmental  sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with profound affect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in greener roof designs, biodegradable materials,and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by  Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by  Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as  Ian McHarg and  Sim Van der Ryn in the US and  Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet  green building  sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques. The U.S. Green Building Council's  LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this. An example of an architecturally innovative green building is the  Dynamic Tower which will be powered by  wind turbines and  solar panels.

The African Grey Hornbill (Tockus nasutus) is a  hornbill. Hornbills are a family of tropical  near-passerine birds found in the  Old World.
The African Grey Hornbill is a widespread and common resident breeder in much of sub-Saharan Africa and into  Arabia.
This is a bird mainly of open woodland and savannah. The female lays two to four white eggs in a  tree hollow, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks.
When the chicks and female outgrow the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall, after which both parents feed the chicks.
This species is a large bird, at 45 cm in length, but is one of the smaller hornbills. It has mainly grey plumage, with the head, flight feathers and long tail being a darker shade. There is a white line down each side of the head and one on the back which is visible only in flight. The long curved bill is black and has a small casque and a creamy horizontal stripe.
The male has a black bill, whereas the female has red on the mandibles. The plumage of the male and female is similar. Immature birds are more uniformly grey. The flight is undulating. The similarly sized  Red-billed Hornbill has uniformly grey plumage.
The African Grey Hornbill is omnivorous, taking insects, fruit and reptiles. It feeds mainly in trees.
This conspicuous bird advertises its presence with its incongruous piping pee-o pee-o pee-o call.

The African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus) is a medium-sized parrot of the genus Psittacus, endemic to primary and secondary rainforest of West and Central Africa, and is one of the most intelligent birds. They feed primarily on nuts and fruits, supplemented by leafy matter.
There are two  subspecies; the Congo African Grey Parrot and the slightly smaller Timneh African Grey Parrot. As their names imply, both subspecies are predominantly grey. They have dark grey wings, and a pale-grey rump. A featherless rim of skin around the eyes is whitish to light grey. The head and neck feathers have paler margins, giving that part of the body a scalloped appearance. The Congo African Grey has a red tail and the Timneh African Grey has a dark-maroon tail.
The African Grey Parrot is popular as a  pet or  companion parrot, especially the Congo African Grey Parrot, partly because of its ability to imitate speech. The African Grey Parrot is listed on CITES appendix II which restricts trade of wild caught species, because wild populations can not sustain trapping for the pet trade.
The African Grey Parrot was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work,  Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original name of Psittacus erithacus. It is the only currently accepted species of the genus Psittacus. The generic name is derived from Ancient Greek psittakos (ψιττακος), &quot;parrot&quot;.
There are two  subspecies universally accepted:
Some aviculturalists recognize a third and even a fourth subspecies, but these are not distinguishable in scientific studies.
The &quot;Ghana African Grey&quot;, formerly recognized as subspecies Psittacus erithacus princeps, is described as similar to the Congo African Greys, but darker and slightly smaller which originates from Fernando Po and Principé Islands.
The &quot;Cameroon African Grey&quot;, most often referred to as &quot;the big silvers&quot;, is supposedly a larger and lighter form which actually has its origin in birds not from Cameroon but from today's Democratic Republic of the Congo.
While comparative judgements of  animal intelligence are always very difficult to make objectively, Psittaciformes are generally regarded as being the most intelligent of birds. African grey parrots are particularly noted for their  cognitive abilities, believed to have evolved as a consequence of their history of  cooperative feeding as largely tree-dwelling birds in central Africa.
 Irene Pepperberg's extensive research with captive African greys, especially the one known as  Alex, have provided evidence that these parrots are capable of associating human words with their meanings, at least to some extent, though these conclusions are disputed. Ambitious claims of language use have been made for another African grey,  N'kisi, who has a vocabulary of around a thousand words and speaks in sentences. Although there exists a great deal of debate as to just how well these birds actually understand the meaning of the words they speak, there is little doubt that Greys and other parrots (especially  macaws and  cockatoos), along with corvines (crows, ravens, and  jays), are highly intelligent in comparison with other birds.
It is widely believed in the parrot-keeping community that Greys understand their human companions at various human intelligence levels. For example, some believe that a young Grey (under a year) has the equivalent understanding of a human child in their toddler years, and that it is believed to be equivalent to a 6-year-old human child in its cognitive ability.
The history of African Grey parrots kept as pets dates back over 4,000 years. Some Egyptian  hieroglyphics clearly depict pet parrots. The ancient Greeks also valued parrots as pets. This custom was later adopted by wealthy Roman families who often kept parrots in ornate  cages, and parrots were prized for their ability to talk. King Henry VIII of England also had an African Grey parrot. Portuguese sailors kept them as companions on their long sea voyages.
Today, many African Grey parrots are hand-reared by breeders for the pet trade, and they can make wonderful and very affectionate  companion parrots; however, the methods used to produce the birds for the pet trade greatly affects their behaviour and 'pet quality' once the birds are mature at 2 to 4 years old. The hand-rearing process, deprives the birds of parental interactions, which results in the birds becoming imprinted on humans at maturity. This is done primarally to produce tamer birds; often breeder birds are not tamed and may be fearful of humans; babies learn how to interact with humans from their parents' behavior. The degree to which a bird was hand reared may vary; some are hand-reared from point of (artificial) incubation; others may be left with their parents for a few weeks, depending on the breeder's method. The degree to which a bird has been deprived of its natural parents can adversely affect its behaviour once it is an adult; birds which have been raised largely or solely by their natural parents tend to show fewer behavioural problemes upon maturity, though they may be less tame (Schmid et al 2005). Some breeders may hand rear babies in the presence of tame adult greys that may serve as role models for the babies. Also to consider is how a baby grey is weaned and fledged. A baby grey should be abundance-weaned (allowed to wean at its own pace) and allowed to learn to fly. Force-weaning and clipping a baby before it learns to fly are believed to occasionally cause development of fearful behaviors when the young grey reaches several years of age. Some grey parrots may not be compatible with small children. African Grey parrots are very strong, and they can inflict serious wounds on human flesh with their powerful beaks. Their nails are naturally sharp and can scratch, although they don't use them aggressively. Pet owners often liken the experience of keeping an African Grey to that of raising a young child, not only because of the birds' intelligence, but also arising from the substantial time commitment required. While captive-bred birds usually assimilate into their new households with relative ease, wild-caught African Grey parrots (which are no longer legally available in the US or EU) can find it difficult or impossible to adapt to life in a cage as a pet. They may show great fear of humans and emit a growling sound as a fear response and may panic when approached. Unlike more common pets, African Grey parrots have not been greatly &quot;modified&quot; by selective breeding; they are only available as wild-type birds. As opposed to the many colour varieties available in  budgies and Rose-ringed Parakeets, the closest African Grey Parrots get to a colour variant are the &quot;Cameroon African Greys&quot; which, are a natural variation of the normal wild bird's colour.
African Grey parrots, like most pet parrots, are considered by many to be very high-maintenance pets, as they require a good deal of personal attention and many hours each day out of their cages. While numbers vary with each source, most agree that three hours out of cage daily and 45 minutes of physical interaction is the minimum attention required for good mental health. African Greys – particularly Congo African Greys – are known to be wary of strangers, and tend to bond solely with their main carer if they do not interact with different people regularly. While interspecies friendships with other parrots are uncommon with African Greys, as essentially social animals, they will benefits from being kept in the company of other birds.
Grey parrots are prone to behavioural problems if they are not provided with a stimulating environment and allowed plenty of time out of their cage each day. They should be given a range of toys, changed regularly, to keep them occupied and these toys should include destructible ones made from natural materials such as cardboard and natural fibres. Toys should also include 'puzzle toys'. These hold food treats and require the bird to learn how to extract the food from the toy. Boredom and over-use of the cage can typically lead to problems such as self-plucking, where the bird damages or removes its own feathers. Many Greys are traditionally kept in small cages (small enough to prevent the bird from flying). Occasionally for clumsy or very nervous greys (often greys that have been clipped at a young age), a smaller cage may be necessary for a time to avoid the bird falling and injuring itself or becoming frightened. However, most greys will benefit greatly from a large cage which allows more space for different perches, toys, and exercise. Provided the bird spends several hours each day out of the cage, interacting with its carer and/or other birds and people, a cage which is 4 feet long by 3 feet deep and 3 feet high is adequate. The bar-spacing should be ¾ inch to 1 inch. The height of a cage is typically not important, except in the case of playtop cages that are taller than the owner, in which case the bird may show some aggressive behaviours. Grey parrots kept as companion animals should have access to a range of other places within the room in which they are kept and these should include a playstand which holds a range of perches and further toys. A companion African Grey should be kept in a  bird-safe environment and placed in a fairly 'busy' part of the home, such as the living room, where the bird can occupy himself or herself in watching the household activities. However, the cage should always have a solid back or be placed against a solid wall, as this helps to give the bird a feeling of security not otherwise available to the 'goldfish bowl effect' of being in a cage.
Grey parrots should be trained to accept some requests or 'commands' from their carers, including flight requests (Glendell 2007).  Wing clipping is very controversial. Some owners prefer to clip to prevent a parrot from flying in the house and potentially getting into danger. However, African greys are heavy-bodied birds and more prone to clipping-related problems. Clipped birds may crash-land and injure themselves, often on the sternum. Clipped birds may also damage their new 'blood' feathers as these grow down in the moulting process and this can result in persistent bleeding and is painful for the bird. Severely clipped birds may have balance problems and fall often. Greys should never be clipped until after they have learned to fly; ideally, they should not be clipped at all for the first 1-2 years. If a grey must be clipped, it must be done by someone experienced with greys; a clipped grey should still be able to fly or glide short distances to avoid injury. Birds with clipped or damaged flight feathers can have flight restored immediately by a specialist avian vet imping (splinting) donor feathers back onto the bird's clipped feathers. Birds which have evolved as fundamentally flying creatures have no behavioural reperetoire to cope with enforced flightlessness (Glendell 2008) and such a degree of disabling can have adverse effects on the bird's well-being. Using reward-based training methods based on applied behaviour analysis (see Dr Susan Friendman's articles at www.thegabriellefoundation.org) most birds can be taught to fly to and from their carers on request. They can also be taught to fly off certain places in the home which may not be safe for them to perch on. This basic training obviates the need for any wing-clipping and allows the bird to perform its normal behaviours. Wing clipping is a severe form of environmental impoverishment to a creature which is adapted to a flying lifestyle.
African Greys have special dietary requirements, and should be fed plenty of foods rich in calcium and Vitamin A — such as almonds, small amounts of cheese, or leafy greens including mustard greens or broccoli. It is usual to give African grey parrots carefully calculated quantities of calcium and vitamin supplements. An excess of these added vitamins and minerals in an African Grey’s diet can lead to health problems. If very young birds are wing-clipped, they may never gain full coordination and agility in flight. Feather clipping should never be attempted by those inexperienced at it, as serious injury could result. African Grey parrots' lifespans are up to about 60 years, or more, in captivity.

        
Rarer than previously believed, it is uplisted from a species of Least Concern to Near Threatened in the 2007  IUCN Red List. A recent analysis suggests that up to 21% of the global population may be taken from the wild annually, primarily for the pet trade.
The species is endemic to primary and secondary rainforest of West and Central Africa. Grey parrots depend on large, old trees for the large natural hollows used for nesting. Studies in Guinea and Guinea-Bissau have found that the preferred species of nesting trees for grey parrots are also preferred timber species. There is a positive relationship between the status of the species and the status of  primary forest: where the forests are declining, so too are populations of grey parrots.
The African Grey Parrot is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This requires that exports be accompanied by a permit issued by a national authority and that a finding has been made that the export is non-detrimental to the species in the wild. With exports totaling more than 350,000 specimens from 1994-2003, the grey parrot is one of the most heavily-traded CITES-listed bird species. In response to continuing population declines, exceeded quotas and unsustainable and illegal trade, including among range States, CITES included the grey parrot in Phase VI of the CITES Review of Significant Trade in 2004. This review has resulted in recommended zero export quotas for several range States and a CITES Decision to develop regional management plans for the species.
In the United States, importation of wild-caught grey parrots is prohibited under the U.S. Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. In the European Union, an EU Directive of 2007 prevents importation of this and any other 'wild-caught' bird for the pet trade.

The Harrier Hawk, African Harrier Hawk or Gymnogene (Polyboroides typus) is a bird of prey. It is about 60-66cm in length, and is related to the  harriers. It breeds in most of Africa south of the Sahara. The only other member of the genus is the  allopatric  Madagascar Harrier Hawk.
Its habitat is woodland preferably with palm trees and often near water. It builds a stick nest in the fork of a tree or the crown of a palm tree. The clutch is one to three eggs.
The Harrier Hawk is a medium-sized raptor. The upperparts, head and breast are pale grey. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The broad wings are pale grey with a black trailing edge fringed with a narrow white line. The tail is black with a single broad white band. There is a bare facial patch of variable colour. Sexes are similar, but young birds have pale brown instead grey, and dark brown replacing black.
The Harrier Hawk is omnivorous, eating the fruit of the  Oil Palm as well as hunting vertebrates. Its ability to climb, using wings as well as feet, and its long double-jointed legs, enable this bird to raid the hole nests of  barbets and  woodhoopoes for  fledglings. A comparable leg-structure and behaviour can be found in the  Neotropical  Crane Hawk; a case of  convergent evolution. The call is a whistled sueee-sueee-sueee.

Abraham Lincoln  / ˈ eɪ b r ə h æ m   ˈ l ɪ ŋ k ən / (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the  16th President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until  his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln successfully led the United States through its greatest constitutional, military, and moral crisis – the American Civil War – preserving the  Union. Reared in a poor family on the  western frontier, Lincoln was mostly self-educated, and became a country lawyer, a  Whig Party leader,  Illinois state legislator during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1840s.
After a  series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival,  Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln, a moderate from a swing state, secured the  Republican Party presidential nomination in 1860. With almost no support in the South, Lincoln swept the  North and was  elected president in 1860. His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their  secession from the Union and form the  Confederacy. The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln's party firm control of Congress, but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found. Lincoln explained in his  second inaugural address: &quot;Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.&quot;
When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on  Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His goal was now to reunite the nation. As the South was in a state of insurrection, Lincoln exercised his authority to suspend  habeas corpus, arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial. Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the  Trent affair in late 1861. His efforts toward the  abolition of slavery include issuing his  Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the  Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which finally freed all the slaves nationwide in December 1865. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general Ulysses S. Grant. Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate. Under Lincoln's leadership, the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, took control of the  border slave states at the start of the war, gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems, and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at  Richmond, Virginia. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.
An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to  War Democrats and managed his own re-election in the  1864 presidential election. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln found his policies and personality were &quot;blasted from all sides&quot;:  Radical Republicans demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats desired more compromise,  Copperheads despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of  Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general  Robert E. Lee, however, Lincoln was  assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer  John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln's death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation into  mourning. Lincoln has been consistently  ranked by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents, the others by scholars being George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt,  and by the public, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of  Thomas Lincoln and  Nancy Lincoln (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the  Sinking Spring Farm in  Hardin County, Kentucky (now  LaRue County). He is descended from  Samuel Lincoln, who arrived in  Hingham, Massachusetts, from Norfolk, England, in the 17th century. Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake,  Abraham, had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, with his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looking on. Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier. Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now  Mineral County, West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought and sold several farms, including  Knob Creek Farm. The family attended a  Separate Baptists church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two 600-acre (240 ha) farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county. However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty  property titles.
The family  moved north across the Ohio River to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then  Perry County but is now  Spencer County, Indiana. Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; but mainly due to land title difficulties. In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of  milk sickness in 1818. After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister,  Sarah, took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son.
Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow  Sarah Bush Johnston, the mother of three children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as &quot;Mother&quot;. As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighbourhood, for a time considered him to be lazy. As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, &quot;the Clary's Grove boys&quot;. Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21. In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money. Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education. While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village. He read and reread the King James Bible,  Aesop's Fables,  Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress,  Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and Franklin's Autobiography.
In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land in  Macon County, Illinois, another free, non-slave state. In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a  new homestead in  Coles County, Illinois. It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old, Lincoln decided to seek a better life and struck out on his own. Canoeing down the  Sangamon River, Lincoln ended up in the village of  New Salem in  Sangamon County. In the spring of 1831, hired by New Salem businessman  Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods by  flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home.
Lincoln's first romantic interest was  Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.
In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to  Mary Todd, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in  Lexington, Kentucky. They met in  Springfield, Illinois, in December 1839 and were engaged the following December. A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;
In 1844, the couple bought  a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.  Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and  Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln &quot;was remarkably fond of children&quot;, and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children. Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis.  &quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son,  Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. His last descendant, grandson  Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died in 1985.
The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875. Abraham Lincoln suffered from &quot; melancholy&quot;, a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression.
Lincoln's father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington. He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.
In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in  New Salem, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the  Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.
Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the  Black Hawk War. Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm), he was tall and &quot;strong enough to intimidate any rival&quot;. At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and threw him. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.
Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading  Blackstone's  Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: &quot;I studied with nobody&quot;. His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a  Whig, many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.  Admitted to the bar in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under  John T. Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin. Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with  Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844, when he began his practice with  William Herndon, whom Lincoln thought &quot;a studious young man&quot;. He served four successive terms in the  Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.
In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not. He was known for his &quot;free soil&quot; stance of opposing both slavery and  abolitionism. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, &quot;[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot; He closely followed  Henry Clay in supporting the  American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa.
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast  Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be, &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;. The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund  internal improvements including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.
In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman  Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters. On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the  Mexican–American War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood&quot;. Lincoln also supported the  Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his  Spot Resolutions. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S.; Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil&quot;. Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil. Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln&quot;. Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the  1848 presidential election. Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the  General Land Office, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival,  Justin Butterfield, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an &quot;old fossil&quot;. The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the  Oregon Territory. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling &quot;every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer&quot;. Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. His reputation grew, and he appeared before the Supreme Court of the United States, arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received  a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.
In 1851, he represented the  Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the  Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favour. From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the  Illinois Central Railroad.
Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended  William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by  judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a  Farmers' Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, such as Illinois. Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west. He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery  Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting  Missouri Compromise (1820). Senior Senator  Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois had incorporated  popular sovereignty into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress.  Eric Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the  republicanism principles of the  Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the  Declaration of Independence.
On October 16, 1854, in his &quot; Peoria Speech&quot;, Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a &quot;declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ...&quot;
In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for  Lyman Trumbull, who defeated opponent  Joel Aldrich Matteson. The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery.&quot; Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted  Free Soil,  Liberty, and  Democratic Party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new  Republican Party. At the  1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president.
In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President James Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the  Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a  slave state. In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in  Dred Scott v. Sandford; Chief Justice  Roger B. Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the  Slave Power. Lincoln argued, &quot;The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in colour, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;
After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his  House Divided Speech, drawing on  Mark 3:25: &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator.
The Senate campaign featured the seven  Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that &quot; The Slave Power&quot; was threatening the values of  republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that  all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his  Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas'  popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.
On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a  speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;. Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist  Noah Brooks reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot; Historian  Donald described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's ( William H. Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ( Salmon P. Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery.&quot; In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste is in my mouth a little.&quot;
On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in  Decatur. Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by  David Davis,  Norman Judd,  Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father, Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of &quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;. On May 18, at the  Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat,  Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff. On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me&quot;.
Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the  Democratic convention, disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected  John C. Breckinridge as their candidate.
As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of &quot;free labor&quot;, whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and  John Bell of the new  Constitutional Union Party. He was the first president from the Republican Party. Winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North and West, no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South. Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the  electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were  fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.
As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the  Confederate States of America. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected  Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.
There were attempts at compromise. The  Crittenden Compromise would have extended the  Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot; Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the  Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and protected slavery in those states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A few weeks before the war, letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.
En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then  evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security,  Allan Pinkerton. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed his  inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot; The failure of the  Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was implausible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina,  Major Robert Anderson, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at  Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian  Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion. William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war. Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;
On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of  Richmond so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.
Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links  attacked Union troops traveling to the capital.  George William Brown, the Mayor of Baltimore, and other suspected Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without a warrant, as Lincoln suspended the writ of  habeas corpus.  John Merryman, a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice  Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus, saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merryman's release, but Lincoln ignored it. Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy, often  vituperative attack from antiwar Democrats, called  Copperheads.
After the fall of  Fort Sumter, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as  commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the  Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy
In late August 1861, General  John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting Washington, a proclamation of  martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be  court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the  Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.
The  Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain. Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the Trent affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner, the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy.
To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied  Henry Halleck's book, Elements of Military Art and Science from the  Library of Congress. Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming in to the  War Department in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced  Simon Cameron with  Edwin Stanton as  War Secretary. Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats (he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election) who became anti-slavery Republicans under Lincoln's leadership. In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General  Henry Halleck, a student of the European strategist  Jomini, of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River; he also knew well the importance of  Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.
After the Union defeat at the  First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged  Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General  George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his  Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the  Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.
Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed  Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862, after McClellan's &quot;Harrison's Landing Letter&quot;, in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint  John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new  Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the  Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the  CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the  USS Monitor. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the  Battle of Hampton Roads.
Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General  Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the  Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the  Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an  Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation. McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General  Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the  Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with  William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican  Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.
Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the  Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at  Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in  Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.
The  mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus,  the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were &quot;depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress&quot;.
In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.
Hooker was routed by Lee at the  Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in  Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by  George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the  Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbour. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.
Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept  compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the  Founding Fathers, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General  John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General  David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.
On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second  Confiscation Act was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that &quot;as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free.&quot;
Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor  Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his &quot;official duty&quot;) was preserving the Union:
The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.
Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up  colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the  War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.
Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, he was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;. By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General  Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: &quot;In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular colour&quot;.
With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the  New York City draft riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery. Defying Lincoln's prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,&quot; the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.
The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the  Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.
Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General Ulysses S. Grant's victories at the  Battle of Shiloh and in the  Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot; With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.
Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.
Grant waged his bloody  Overland Campaign in 1864. This is often characterized as a  war of attrition, given high Union losses at battles such as the  Battle of the Wilderness and  Cold Harbour. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had &quot;almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces&quot;. The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;
The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the  James River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced his losses.
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and  Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's  Shenandoah Valley. The damage caused by  Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60-mile (97 km) swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in &quot;total war&quot; against civilians, as in World War II.
Confederate general  Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's  raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain  Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot; After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.
As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President  Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at  Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the  Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but  freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox and the war was effectively over.
Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in  War Democrats such as  Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new  Union Party.
When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:
Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
While the Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;, their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and  David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the  perfidy of the Copperheads. Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his  second inaugural address. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian  Mark Noll concludes it ranks &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world&quot;. Lincoln said:
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot; In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep.  Thaddeus Stevens, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen.  Benjamin Wade, political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His  Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.
As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and  Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General  Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the  Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.
Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals,  Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot;. By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery absolutely was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Upon ratification, it became the  Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.
As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of  freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's  Freedman's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.
In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of  republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.
In March 1861, in his  First Inaugural Address, Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the  Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The  Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The  Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third  Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the  Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($20,700 in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the  Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.
Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the  National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the  Department of Agriculture. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the &quot; Sioux Uprising&quot; in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted  Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.
In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the  New York World and the  Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behaviour; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.
Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the  Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as  Yosemite National Park.
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot; Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court.  Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union.  Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist.  David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit.  Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary,  Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, and 27 judges to the  United States district courts. Lincoln appointed no judges to the  United States circuit courts during his time in office.
West Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery.  Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.
 John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners.
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending  Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State  William H. Seward and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard,  Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play  Our American Cousin on April 14. Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play.
Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theatre during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major  Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.
After being on the run for 10 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some 70 miles (110 km) south of Washington, D.C. After a brief fight with Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant  Boston Corbett on April 26.
An Army surgeon, Doctor  Charles Leale, was sitting nearby at the theatre and immediately assisted the President. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally. The dying man was taken across the street to  Petersen House. After being in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. Presbyterian minister  Phineas Densmore Gurley, then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, &quot;Now he belongs to the ages.&quot;
Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach &quot;United States&quot; and for three weeks the Lincoln Special  funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by.
As a young man, Lincoln was clearly a  religious skeptic, or, in the words of a biographer, even an  iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly  evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife, but he was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoted it and praised it.
In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot; On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife Mary at  Ford's Theatre he desired to visit the  Holy Land.
In  surveys of scholars ranking Presidents since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, Chicago Tribune 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, Time 2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1) Lincoln; 2) George Washington; and 3) Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.
President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.
Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the  Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington. In the  New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.
By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to  political conservatives for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the  agrarian Democrats. William C. Harris found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism.&quot;. James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.&quot; Randall concludes that, &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;
By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian  Lerone Bennett, were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed  sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians; and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered &quot;erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule,&quot; in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of  negative capability, defined by the poet  John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were &quot;content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason.&quot;
Lincoln appears on the penny and the $5 bill, and on many postage stamps. He has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the  capital of Nebraska.
The most famous and most visited memorials are the  Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln's sculpture on Mount Rushmore;  Ford's Theatre and  Petersen House (where he died) in Washington and the  Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, located in Springfield, Illinois, not far from  Lincoln's Tomb.
Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.&quot; During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful.&quot; Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot; However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.&quot; He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was the  seventh President of the United States (1829–1837). Based in frontier Tennessee, Jackson was a politician and army general who defeated the  Creek Indians at the  Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814), and the British at the  Battle of New Orleans (1815). A polarizing figure who dominated the  Second Party System in the 1820s and 1830s, as president he dismantled the  Second Bank of the United States and initiated forced relocation and resettlement of Native American tribes from the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River. His enthusiastic followers created the modern  Democratic Party. The 1830–1850 period later became known as the era of  Jacksonian democracy.
Jackson was nicknamed &quot;Old Hickory&quot; because of his toughness and aggressive personality; he fought in  duels, some fatal to his opponents. He was a wealthy slaveholder. He fought politically against what he denounced as a closed, undemocratic aristocracy, adding to his appeal to  common citizens. He expanded the  spoils system during his presidency to strengthen his political base.
Elected president in 1828, Jackson supported a small and limited federal government. He strengthened the power of the presidency, which he saw as spokesman for the entire population, as opposed to Congressmen from a specific small district. He was supportive of  states' rights, but during the  Nullification Crisis, declared that states do not have the right to nullify federal laws. Strongly against the  national bank, he vetoed the renewal of its charter and ensured its collapse. Whigs and moralists denounced his aggressive enforcement of the  Indian Removal Act, which resulted in the forced relocation of thousands of  Native Americans to  Indian Territory (now  Oklahoma). Historians acknowledge his protection of popular democracy and individual liberty for United States citizens, but criticize him for his support for  slavery and for his role in  Indian removal.
Jackson was born on March 15, 1767. His parents were  Scots-Irish colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson,  Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier. Jackson's father was born in  Carrickfergus,  County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738. Jackson's parents lived in the village of  Boneybefore, also in County Antrim. Their former house is preserved as the  Andrew Jackson Centre and is open to the public.
When they emigrated to America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the  Waxhaws region, straddling the border between  North and  South Carolina. They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).
Jackson's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born in the  Waxhaws area. His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not officially been surveyed.
In 1824, Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in  Lancaster County, South Carolina. But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the  Tariff of 1824, which Jackson opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.
Jackson received a sporadic education in the local &quot;old-field&quot; school. In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop. Later, he taught school and studied law in  Salisbury, North Carolina. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to  Jonesborough, in what was then the  Western District of North Carolina. This area later became the  Southwest Territory (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.
During the American Revolutionary War, Jackson, at age thirteen, joined a local militia as a courier. His eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion during the  Battle of Stono Ferry, on June 20, 1779. Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity. When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British. While imprisoned, the brothers contracted smallpox.
Robert Jackson died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release. After being assured Andrew would recover, Elizabeth Jackson volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in  Charleston harbour, where there had been an outbreak of cholera. She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave. Jackson became an orphan at age 14. Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war, Jackson blamed the British for his losses.
Jackson began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee. Though his legal education was scanty, he knew enough to be a  country lawyer on the  frontier. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law. Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from  assault and  battery. In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the  Territory South of the River Ohio after 1791.
Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee  constitutional convention in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, Jackson was elected its U.S. Representative. The following year, he was elected U.S. Senator as a  Democratic-Republican, but he resigned within a year. In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the  Tennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1804.
In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as  planter, slave owner, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store in  Gallatin, Tennessee in 1803. The next year he acquired  the Hermitage, a 640-acre (259 ha) plantation in  Davidson County, near Nashville. Jackson later added 360 acres (146 ha) to the plantation, which eventually grew to 1,050 acres (425 ha). The primary crop was cotton, grown by enslaved workers. Starting with nine slaves, Jackson held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.
Jackson was a major land speculator in West Tennessee after he had negotiated the sale of the land from the  Chickasaw Nation in 1818 (termed the  Jackson Purchase). He was one of the three original investors who founded  Memphis, Tennessee in 1819 (see  History of Memphis, Tennessee).
Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of  colonel. He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.
During the  War of 1812, the  Shawnee  chief  Tecumseh encouraged the &quot; Red Stick&quot; Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements. He had unified tribes in the  Northwest to rise up against the Americans, trying to repel European American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio. Four hundred settlers were killed in the  Fort Mims massacre. In the resulting  Creek War, Jackson commanded the American forces, which included Tennessee militia, U.S.  regulars, and  Cherokee,  Choctaw, and  Lower Creek warriors.
Jackson defeated the Red Sticks at the  Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but Jackson spared the chief  Red Eagle, a mixed-race man also known as  William Weatherford.  Sam Houston and  David Crockett served under Jackson in this campaign. After the victory, Jackson imposed the  Treaty of Fort Jackson upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty million acres (81,000 km²) in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement. Jackson was appointed Major General after this action.
Jackson's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success. When British forces threatened  New Orleans, Jackson took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. They said he was &quot;tough as old hickory&quot; wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of &quot;Old Hickory&quot;. In the  Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, Jackson's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British. At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.
Jackson became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the war. He received the  Thanks of Congress and a gold medal by resolution of February 27, 1815.  Alexis de Tocqueville later commented in  Democracy in America that Jackson &quot;...was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.&quot;
Jackson served in the military again during the  First Seminole War. He was ordered by President James Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in  Georgia against the  Seminole and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing  Spanish Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His directions were to &quot;terminate the conflict&quot;. Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida. Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, &quot;Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.&quot; Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.
The Seminole attacked Jackson's Tennessee volunteers. The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned their houses and the crops. He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians. Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense. Jackson captured  Pensacola, Florida, with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects,  Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as &quot;Sharp Knife&quot;).
The executions, and Jackson's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident. Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be  censured. The  Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, an early believer in Manifest Destiny, defended Jackson. When the Spanish minister demanded a &quot;suitable punishment&quot; for Jackson, Adams wrote back, &quot;Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them.&quot; Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the  Adams–Onís Treaty. Jackson was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.
The Tennessee legislature nominated Jackson for President in 1822. It also elected him U.S. Senator again. By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party. Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal  Congressional nominating caucus, but this had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary  William H. Crawford for President and  Albert Gallatin for Vice President. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the &quot;voice of the people&quot; and was a &quot;vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate&quot;. Gallatin criticized Jackson as &quot;an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office&quot;.
Besides Jackson and Crawford, the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and House Speaker  Henry Clay were also candidates. Jackson received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot). The  electoral votes were split four ways, with Jackson having a plurality. Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, which chose Adams. Jackson supporters denounced this result as a &quot; corrupt bargain&quot; because Clay gave his state's support to Adams, who subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State. As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for Adams, and Jackson had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized Clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors. Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the &quot;man of the people&quot; had been robbed by the &quot;corrupt aristocrats of the East&quot;.
Jackson resigned from the Senate in October 1825, but continued his quest for the Presidency. The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President. Jackson attracted Vice President  John C. Calhoun, Martin Van Buren, and  Thomas Ritchie into his camp (Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford). Van Buren, with help from his friends in Philadelphia and  Richmond, revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, &quot;restored party rivalries&quot;, and forged a national organization of durability. The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828.
During the election, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a &quot; jackass&quot;. Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. However, it later became the symbol for the  Democratic Party when cartoonist  Thomas Nast popularized it.
The campaign was very much a personal one. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife  Rachel of bigamy. Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife. Rachel died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.
Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the  White House ball honoring his first inauguration. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes. The crowd became so large that Jackson's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken. Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President. The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside. Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname &quot;King Mob&quot;.
In the 1832 presidential election, Jackson easily won reelection as the candidate of the  Democratic Party against  Henry Clay, of the  National Republican Party, and  William Wirt, of the  Anti-Masonic Party. The Anti-Masonic Party used Northern sentiment against  Freemasonry to attack Jackson, who was a  Mason.  John C. Calhoun, Vice President under John Quincy Adams and during part of Jackson's first term, had resigned over differences with Jackson, particularly over  nullification and the  Petticoat affair; Jackson replaced him with longtime confidant Martin Van Buren of New York.
In January 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished. However, this accomplishment was short lived. A severe  depression from 1837 to 1844 caused the national debt to increase to over $3.3 million by January 1, 1838 and it has not been paid in full since.
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the  Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President. In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view &quot;I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress.&quot;
When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of  rotation in office by political appointments, declaring it &quot;a leading principle in the republican creed&quot;. He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. To strengthen party loyalty, Jackson's supporters wanted to give the posts to party members, a patronage system. In practice, this meant replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists. By the end of his term, Jackson dismissed nearly 20% of the Federal employees at the start of it, replacing them with political appointees from his party. While Jackson did not start the &quot;spoils system&quot;, he did encourage its growth for many years to come. It led to its own kind of corruption, including the appointment of officials with no experience related to their responsibilities.
The  Second Bank of the United States was authorized for a 20-year period during James Madison's tenure in 1816. As President, Jackson worked to rescind the bank's federal charter. In Jackson's veto message, the bank needed to be abolished because:
Following Jefferson, Jackson supported an &quot;agricultural republic&quot; and felt the Bank improved the fortunes of an &quot;elite circle&quot; of commercial and industrial entrepreneurs at the expense of farmers and laborers. After a titanic struggle, Jackson succeeded in destroying the Bank by vetoing its 1832 re-charter by Congress and by withdrawing U.S. funds in 1833. (See  Banking in the Jacksonian Era)
The bank's money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that sprang up. This increased credit and speculation. At first, as Jackson withdrew money from the Bank to invest it in other banks, land sales, canal construction, cotton production, and manufacturing boomed. Then, in 1836, Jackson issued the  Specie Circular, which required buyers of government lands to pay in &quot;specie&quot; (gold or silver coins). The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes. These banks collapsed. This was a direct cause of the  Panic of 1837, which threw the national economy into a deep  depression. It took years for the economy to recover from the damage.
The U.S. Senate censured Jackson on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States. When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged.
Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the &quot; Nullification Crisis&quot;, or &quot;secession crisis&quot;, of 1828 – 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the &quot; Tariff of Abominations&quot;) on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.
The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in the  South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, supported the claim of his home state,  South Carolina, that it had the right to &quot;nullify&quot;—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.
Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts.  Robert Hayne began by toasting to &quot;The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States&quot;. Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added &quot;Our federal Union: It must be preserved!&quot; – a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding &quot;The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!&quot;
Jackson's alliance with Calhoun was further strained by what became known as the  Petticoat affair;  Floride Calhoun, the Vice President's wife, led several other Cabinet members and their wives in the social ostracism of Secretary of War  John H. Eaton and his wife,  Margaret O'Neill Eaton. The internal roil eventually led Eaton to resign and caused the purge of the several pro-Calhoun cabinet members by Jackson. As a strategic move Martin Van Buren resigned (as Secretary of State) but remained a close confident of Jackson; he helped organize and played a leading role in the Jackson's unofficial  Kitchen Cabinet
At the  first Democratic National Convention, which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet, Calhoun and Jackson broke from each other politically and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate in the  1832 presidential election. In December 1832, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.
In response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops to  South Carolina to enforce the laws. In December, 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the &quot;nullifiers&quot;, stating that he considered &quot;the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed&quot;. South Carolina, the President declared, stood on &quot;the brink of insurrection and treason&quot;, and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: &quot;The Constitution... forms a government not a league... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation.&quot;
Jackson asked Congress to pass a &quot; Force Bill&quot; explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until  protectionists led by Clay agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance. The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, &quot;the tariff was only the pretext, and  disunion and  southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or  slavery question.&quot;
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Jackson's presidency was his policy regarding Native Americans, which historians see as amounting to the  ethnic cleansing of several Indian tribes. Jackson was a leading advocate of a policy known as Indian removal. Jackson had been negotiating treaties and removal policies with Indian leaders for years before his election as president. Many tribes and portions of tribes had been removed to Arkansas Territory and further west of the Mississippi River without the suffering of what later became known as the  Trail of Tears. Further, many white Americans advocated total extermination of the &quot;savages&quot;, particularly those who had experienced frontier wars. Jackson's support of removal policies can be best understood by examination of those prior cases he had personally negotiated, rather than those in post-presidential years. Nevertheless, Jackson is often held responsible for all that took place in the 1830s.
In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson stated:
Before his election as president, Jackson had been involved with the issue of Indian removal for over ten years. The removal of the Native Americans to the west of the Mississippi River had been a major part of his political agenda in both the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections. After his election he signed the  Indian Removal Act into law in 1830. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.
While frequently frowned upon in the North, and opposed by  Jeremiah Evarts and  Theodore Frelinghuysen, the Removal Act was popular in the South, where population growth and the discovery of gold on  Cherokee land had increased pressure on tribal lands. The state of  Georgia became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision ( Worcester v. Georgia), which ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands. Jackson is often quoted (regarding the decision) as having said, &quot;John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it!&quot; According to Remini, Jackson never said this, as the quote first appeared in  Horace Greeley's The American Conflict in 1864.
In any case, Jackson used the Georgia crisis to pressure Cherokee leaders to sign a removal treaty. A small faction of Cherokees led by  John Ridge negotiated the  Treaty of New Echota with Jackson's representatives. Ridge was not a recognized leader of the  Cherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by most Cherokees as illegitimate. Over 15,000 Cherokees signed a petition in protest of the proposed removal; the list was ignored by the Supreme Court and the U.S. legislature, in part due to delays and timing. The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren, who ordered 7,000 armed troops to remove the Cherokees. Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered until troops arrived. This abrupt and forced removal resulted in the deaths of over 4,000 Cherokees on the &quot; Trail of Tears&quot;.
By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves. Their nonviolent methods earned them the title the  Five Civilized Tribes.
More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration. A few Cherokees escaped forced relocation, or walked back afterwards, escaping to the high  Smoky Mountains along the  North Carolina and  Tennessee border.
Jackson's administration bought about 100 million acres (400,000 km²) of Indian land for about $68 million and 32 million acres (130,000 km²) of western land. Jackson was criticized at the time for his role in these events, and the criticism has grown over the years. U.S. historian  Robert V. Remini characterizes the Indian Removal era as &quot;one of the unhappiest chapters in American history&quot;.
The first presidential attack was against Jackson. Jackson ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the  Navy for  embezzlement. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS Cygnet to  Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of  Mary Ball Washington, George Washington's mother. During a stopover near  Alexandria, Randolph appeared and struck the President. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the well-known writer  Washington Irving. Jackson decided not to press charges.
On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the  United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of  South Carolina Representative  Warren R. Davis,  Richard Lawrence, an unemployed housepainter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring. Lawrence was restrained, and legend says that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including  David Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.
Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the President dead, &quot;money would be more plenty&quot; (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he &quot;could not rise until the President fell&quot;. Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically, Richard III, dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and institutionalized.
Afterward, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same  Providence that protected the young nation. This national pride was a large part of the Jacksonian cultural myth fueling American expansion in the 1830s.
In total Jackson appointed 24 federal judges: six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States and eighteen judges to the  United States district courts.
On the last day of the presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he &quot;had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun.&quot;
Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the widow of  John Donelson. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter,  Rachel Donelson Robards. At the time, Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage. The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson technically bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made. It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.
The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife’s honour. With his anger over attacks about Rachel, and his participation in violent confrontations, Jackson gained a reputation as a quarrelsome and vengeful man. By May 1806,  Charles Dickinson had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a duel. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. However, the bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed. Jackson’s reputation suffered greatly from the duel. 
Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President. Jackson blamed John Quincy Adams for Rachel's death because the episode ridiculing his wife was repeatedly used in the campaign of 1828. He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams.
Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known, Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson,  Daniel Smith Donelson and  Andrew Jackson Donelson were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.
The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece  Emily Donelson to serve as host at the White House. Emily was married to  Andrew Jackson Donelson, who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the  American Party ticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the  Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host.  Sarah Yorke Jackson, the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became cohost of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hosting duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used  Rip Raps as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.
Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics after retiring to  The Hermitage in 1837. Jackson remained a firm advocate of the federal union of the states, and rejected any talk of secession. &quot;I will die with the Union&quot;, he always insisted.
Jackson was a lean figure standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64 kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake. After retiring to Nashville, he enjoyed eight years of retirement and died at  The Hermitage on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, dropsy, and  heart failure.
Jackson was a Freemason, having been initiated at Masonic Lodge, Harmony No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee. He was the only U.S. president to have been a Grandmaster of a State Lodge until Harry S. Truman in 1945. His Masonic apron is on display in the Tennessee State Museum. An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.
In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members. About a year after retiring the presidency, Jackson became a member of the  First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.
Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on US Postage more than the usual two or three times. He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a  postage stamp in his honour until 18 years after his death, with the  issue of 1863, a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the ' Black Jack'. In contrast, the first Warren G. Harding stamp was released only one month after his death, Lincoln, one year exactly. As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait. In all, Jackson has appeared on  thirteen different U.S. postage stamps, more than that of most US presidents and second only to the number of times Washington, Franklin and Lincoln have appeared. During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two  Confederate postage stamps bearing Jackson's portrait, one a  2-cent red stamp and the other a  2-cent green stamp, both issued in 1863.

Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 – July 31, 1875) was the  17th President of the United States, serving from 1865 to 1869. As Abraham Lincoln's  vice president, Johnson became president when  Lincoln was assassinated. A Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the  National Union ticket, Johnson came to office as the Civil War concluded. The new president favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the  former slaves, and he came into conflict with the  Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in  his impeachment by the House of Representatives. The first American president to be impeached, he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.
Johnson was born in poverty in  Raleigh, North Carolina. Apprenticed as a tailor, he worked in several frontier towns before settling in  Greeneville, Tennessee. He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the  Tennessee House of Representatives in 1835. After brief service in the  Tennessee Senate, Johnson was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became  Governor of Tennessee for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the  Homestead Bill, which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862.
As Southern states, including Tennessee, seceded to form the  Confederate States of America, Johnson remained firmly with the Union. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson, as a  War Democrat and  Southern Unionist, was a logical choice as  running mate for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; their ticket easily won. Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865, giving a rambling and possibly drunken speech, and he secluded himself to avoid public ridicule. Six weeks later, the assassination of Lincoln made him president.
Johnson implemented his own form of  Presidential Reconstruction – a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed  Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congress refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congress overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, that gave citizenship to  African American males. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the  Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson in firing Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War  Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. Returning to Tennessee after his presidency, Johnson sought political vindication, and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the Senate again in 1875 (the only former president to serve there), just months before his death. Although Johnson's ranking has fluctuated over time, he is generally considered  among the worst American presidents for his opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African-Americans.
Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on December 29, 1808, to  Jacob Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary (&quot;Polly&quot;) McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He had a brother William, four years his elder, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. (Being born in a  log cabin was a political asset in the 19th century, and in the years to come Johnson would not hesitate to remind voters of his humble birth.) Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as was his father, William, but became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men when Andrew was three. Polly Johnson had worked as a washerwoman; she continued in that trade as the sole support of her children. At the time, her occupation was considered less than respectable as it often took her into others' homes unaccompanied; the Johnsons were considered  white trash, and there were rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his siblings, was fathered by another man. Eventually, Polly Johnson married Turner Doughtry, who was also poor.
Polly Doughtry apprenticed her elder son, William, to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew followed his brother as an apprentice in Selby's shop at the age of ten; he was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Selby does not appear to have had any great influence on the future president. The apprentice was boarded with his mother for part of his service; one of Selby's employees was detailed to teach him rudimentary literacy skills. This minimal education was augmented by citizens who came to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked; even before he was an apprentice, young Andrew came to listen. These readings began a lifelong love of learning for the boy; his biographer, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, who would be acclaimed as a public speaker, learned the basics of that art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.
Andrew Johnson was not happy at James Selby's, and at about age 15, ran away with his brother. Selby responded by placing an advertisement in the paper, as customary for masters seeking missing apprentices, &quot;Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two apprentice boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson ... [payment] to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, or I will give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone.&quot; The boys went to  Carthage, North Carolina, where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be taken and returned to Raleigh, Andrew moved on to  Laurens, South Carolina. There, he found work in his craft, and met his first love, Mary Wood, for whom he made a quilt. After his marriage proposal to her was rejected, Johnson returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but he could not come to terms with Selby. Then, like many others in the late 1820s, he journeyed west.
Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, traveling mostly on foot. After a brief period in  Knoxville, he moved to  Mooresville, Alabama. He then worked as a tailor in  Columbia, Tennessee, but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the  Blue Ridge Mountains to  Greeneville, Tennessee. Andrew Johnson fell in love with the town at first sight, and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration.
In Greeneville, Johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home. In 1827, at the age of 18, he married 16-year-old  Eliza McCardle, the daughter of a local shoemaker. The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln, first cousin of  Thomas Lincoln, whose son would become president. The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852). Though she suffered from consumption, Eliza supported her husband's endeavors. She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing. Shy and retiring by nature, Eliza Johnson usually remained in Greeneville during Johnson's political rise. She was not often seen during her husband's presidency; their daughter Martha usually served as official hostess.
Johnson's tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage, enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate. He later boasted of his talents as a tailor, &quot;my work never ripped or gave way.&quot; He was a voracious reader. Books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue, and he had private debates with customers with opposing views on issues of the day. He also took part in debates at  Greeneville College.
Johnson helped organize a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831  Nat Turner slave rebellion, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to disenfranchise free people of colour. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.
In 1835, Johnson made a bid for election to the &quot;floater&quot; seat which  Greene County shared with neighboring  Washington County in the  Tennessee House of Representatives. According to his biographer, Hans Trefousse, Johnson &quot;demolished&quot; the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin. Soon after taking his seat, Johnson purchased his first slave, Dolly, aged 14. Dolly had three children over the years. Johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly, but the fact that Dolly was dark-skinned, and her offspring much lighter, led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father.
In his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the  Democratic or the newly formed  Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals with the party system in a state of flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After  Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.
In 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren was defeated by former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column. He was elected to the  Tennessee Senate in 1841, where he served a two-year term. He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.
Having served in both houses of the legislature, Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated  Jonesville lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892. In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti- abolitionist stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs. With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favour of study in the  Library of Congress. Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, James K. Polk,  was elected president in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.
Johnson believed, as did many Southern Democrats, that the Constitution protected private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery. He won a second term in 1845 against  Wiliam G. Brownlow, presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy. In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the  Mexican War, seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the  Wilmot Proviso, a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico. He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant 160 acres (65 ha) to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it. This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.
In the  presidential election of 1848, the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the  Free Soil Party, with former president Van Buren as their nominee. Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator  Lewis Cass. With the party split, Whig nominee General Zachary Taylor was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee. Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that
Johnson, in the face of the national interest in new railroad construction, and in response to the need in his own district for better transportation, changed his position. Thereafter, he supported government assistance for the  East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad.
In his campaign for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent,  Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat  Howell Cobb was elected.
Once the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took centre stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's  Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the  Compromise of 1850, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation's capital. He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the  Electoral College), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years. These were all defeated.
A group of Democrats nominated  Landon Carter Haynes to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own. The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition. Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes. Though he was not enamored of the party's presidential nominee, former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, Johnson campaigned for him. Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee. In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate. The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of  Gustavus Henry, redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party. The Nashville Union termed this &quot;Henry-mandering&quot;; lamented Johnson, &quot;I have no political future.&quot;
If Johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek re-election, he soon changed his mind. The congressman's political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor. The Democratic convention unanimously named him, though some party members were not happy at his selection. The Whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections, and still controlled the legislature. That party nominated Henry, making the &quot;Henry-mandering&quot; of the First District an immediate issue. The two men debated in county seats the length of Tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the August 1853 election due to illness in Henry's family. Johnson won the election by 63,413 votes to 61,163; some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig  Nathaniel Taylor for his old seat in Congress.
Tennessee's governor had little power—Johnson could propose legislation but not veto it, and most appointments were made by the Whig-controlled legislature. Nevertheless, the office was a  bully pulpit that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views. He succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of  John Bell, a Whig, for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. In his first biennial speech, Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system, abolishment of the Bank of Tennessee and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures; the last was passed. Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes, either statewide or county by county—a mixture of the two was passed.
Although the Whig Party was on its final decline nationally, it remained strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run.  Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the  nativist positions of the  Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.
When the presidential election of 1856 approached, Johnson hoped to be nominated; some Tennessee county conventions designated him a  favorite son. His position that the best interests of the Union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president. He was never a major contender; the nomination fell to former Pennsylvania senator James Buchanan. Though he was not impressed by either, Johnson campaigned for Buchanan and his running mate, former Kentucky representative  John C. Breckenridge, who were elected.
Johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor, with an eye towards election to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage to his right arm. This injury would trouble him in the years to come.
The victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor  William B. Campbell wrote to his uncle, &quot;The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should the Democrats have the majority, he will certainly be their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson.&quot; The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature. Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond Whig newspaper referring to him as &quot;the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union.&quot;
Johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self-employed tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the &quot;plebians&quot;; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, &quot;Johnson was always the same to everyone ... the honours heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen.&quot; Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, &quot;you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest of us Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you.&quot;
The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor,  James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson immediately set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded  Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in  Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners.
Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it. He argued against funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down  the revolt by the Mormons in  Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.
In October 1859, abolitionist  John Brown and sympathizers  raided the federal arsenal at  Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia). Tensions in Washington between pro- and anti-slavery forces increased greatly. Johnson gave a major speech in the Senate in December, decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery. The Tennessee senator stated that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; from the  Declaration of Independence did not apply to African-Americans, since the  Constitution of Illinois contained that phrase—and that document barred voting by African-Americans.
Johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the 1860 presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the  1860 Democratic National Convention in  Charleston, South Carolina, he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interest in the backroom dealmaking. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator  Stephen Douglas while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator  John Bell running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln.  The election of Lincoln, known to be against slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.
Johnson took to the Senate floor after the election, giving a speech well received in the North, &quot;I will not give up this government ... No; I intend to stand by it ... and I invite every man who is a patriot to ... rally around the altar of our common country ... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved.&quot; As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator  Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon be  the president of the  Confederate States of America, formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.
Johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession. His successor as governor,  Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's  eastern region of Tennessee was against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, the senator fled the state through the  Cumberland Gap, where his party was fired upon; he left his wife and family in Greeneville.
As the only member from a seceded state to remain in the Senate and the most prominent  Southern Unionist, he had Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war. With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.
Johnson's first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were put down in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern areas. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of  brigadier general. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land, took away his slaves, and made his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate and in the absence of most Southern legislators, the  Homestead Act was finally enacted; it, along with legislation for  land grant colleges and for the  transcontinental railroad, has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.
As military governor, Johnson sought to eliminate rebel influences in the state, demanding loyalty oaths from public officials, and shutting down newspapers run by Confederate sympathizers. At that time, much of eastern Tennessee remained in rebel hands, and the ebb and flow of war through 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control close to Nashville. The Confederates did allow his wife and family to pass through the lines to him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could; the city was continually harassed with cavalry raids led by General  Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until  William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at  Murfreesboro at the start of 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was retaken later that year.
When Lincoln issued the  Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, freeing the slaves in rebel-controlled areas, he exempted Tennessee at Johnson's request. The document increased the debate over what should happen to the slaves after the war—not all Unionists supported abolition. Johnson decided that slavery had to end, stating, &quot;If the institution of slavery ... seeks to overthrow it [the Government], then the Government has a clear right to destroy it&quot;. He reluctantly supported efforts to recruit former slaves for the Union Army, feeling it more appropriate that African-Americans should perform menial tasks and free up whites to fight. Nevertheless, he succeeded in enlisting 20,000 black troops for the Union.
In 1860, Lincoln's running mate had been Maine Senator  Hannibal Hamlin. Vice President Hamlin had served competently, was in good health, and had not expressed an unwillingness to run. Nevertheless, Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln's re-election bid in 1864.
Lincoln considered several  War Democrats for the ticket in 1864, and sent an agent to sound out General  Benjamin Butler as a possible running mate. In May 1864, the President dispatched General  Daniel Sickles to Nashville on a fact-finding mission. Although Sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor, Johnson biographer Hans L. Trefousse believes Sickles's trip was connected to Johnson's subsequent nomination for vice president. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. Gordon-Reed points out that while the Lincoln-Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860, &quot;having Johnson, the southern War Democrat, on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country.&quot; Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State  William Seward to frustrate the vice-presidential candidacy of his fellow New Yorker, former senator  Daniel S. Dickinson, a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy.
To sound a theme of unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the  National Union Party, rather than the Republicans. At  the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War  Simon Cameron offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, &quot;Andy Johnson, I think, is a good man.&quot; When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.
Although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president,  George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.
Now Vice President-elect, Johnson was anxious to complete the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.
Johnson duly traveled to Washington to be sworn in, although according to Gordon-Reed, &quot;in light of what happened on March 4, 1865, it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville.&quot; He may have been ill; Castel cited typhoid fever, though Gordon-Reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis. On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honour; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating &quot;I need all the strength for the occasion I can have.&quot; In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president. Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, was sworn in, and delivered his acclaimed  Second Inaugural Address.
In the weeks after the inauguration, Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly, and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend,  Francis Preston Blair. When he did return to Washington, it was with the intent of leaving for Tennessee to re-establish his family in Greeneville. Instead, he remained after word came that General Ulysses S. Grant had captured the Confederate capital of  Richmond, Virginia, presaging the end of the war. Lincoln stated, in response to criticism of Johnson's behaviour, that &quot;I have known Andy Johnson for many years; he made a bad slip the other day, but you need not be scared; Andy ain't a drunkard.&quot;
On the afternoon of April 14, 1865, Lincoln and Johnson met for the first time since the inauguration. Trefousse states that Johnson wanted to &quot;induce Lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors&quot;; Gordon-Reed agrees.
That night, President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by  John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin,  George Atzerodt, got drunk instead of killing the vice president.  Leonard J. Farwell, a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at  Ford's Theatre. Johnson rushed to the President's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, &quot;They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this.&quot; Lincoln died at 7:22 am the next morning; Johnson's swearing in occurred between 10 and 11 am with Chief Justice  Salmon P. Chase presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as &quot;solemn and dignified&quot;. Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration. At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary's office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.
The events of the assassination resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared, after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, &quot;Are you at home? Don't wish to disturb you. J. Wilkes Booth.&quot;
Johnson presided with dignity over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before the leader's body was sent home to  Springfield, Illinois, for burial. Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General William T. Sherman reported he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General  Joseph E. Johnston for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights to be respected. This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery, and was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet. Johnson sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, and he did. This action, together with his placing a $100,000 bounty on the head of Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of  Mary Surratt, the only woman convicted as a member of the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln. Johnson refused to grant clemency, and Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.
Upon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the Southern states. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states. Lincoln had advocated a  ten percent plan that would allow recognized elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty. Congress considered this too lenient;  its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath for a state to be admitted, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln  pocket vetoed it.
Johnson had three goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved &quot;plebians&quot;. Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish.
The Republicans had formed a number of factions. The  Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African-Americans. They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.
Johnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.
Johnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor  Francis Pierpont. The second provided amnesty for all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.
As Southern states began the process of forming governments, Johnson's policies received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African-Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's leniency as an experiment, to be allowed if it brought Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners were emboldened. A number of Southern states passed  Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the delegations headed by Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president  Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory  annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.
Northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders, such as Stephens, rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw. They saw the Black Codes placing African-Americans in a position barely above slavery. Republicans also feared that restoration of the Southern states would return the Democrats to power. In addition, according to David O. Stewart in his book on Johnson's impeachment, &quot;the violence and poverty that oppressed the South would galvanize the opposition to Johnson&quot;.
Congress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South. According to Trefousse, &quot;If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress&quot;. The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans, both for Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict be over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.
Illinois Senator  Lyman Trumbull, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the  Freedman's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures. Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord. The President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. The President vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African-Americans treated fairly.
On February 22, 1866,  Washington's Birthday, Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the Executive Mansion (as the  White House was still formally known) and called for an address in honour of the first president. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of &quot;men ... still opposed to the Union&quot; to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South. When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman  Thaddeus Stevens, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, and abolitionist  Wendell Phillips, and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.
Although strongly urged by Moderates to sign the Civil Rights Bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favour of African-Americans and against whites. Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done in American history. The veto of the  Civil Rights Act of 1866, often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian  Eric Foner in his volume on Reconstruction views it as &quot;the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career&quot;. According to Stewart, the veto was &quot;for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency&quot;.
Congress also proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.
Efforts to compromise failed, and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party, North and South. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had resumed their own banner; the President intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain re-election. The battleground was the  election of 1866; Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the &quot; Swing Around the Circle&quot;. The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction. Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.
Even with the Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson considered himself in a strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or  border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favour, leading to his re-election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators, and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for  Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.
In January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under  martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African-Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the  First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the  Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.
Secretary of War  Edwin Stanton was an able and hard-working man, but difficult to deal with. Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.
The new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examining the President's bank accounts, and summoning members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.
Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General  Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overruled it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General  Philip Sheridan, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support. He was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant. On August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session. Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.
Grant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders,  Daniel Sickles, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the  Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator  Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African-Americans the vote. The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favour to 108 opposed.
Johnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed  Lorenzo Thomas to replace him. Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.
On March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen  George S. Boutwell, Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, and  William M. Evarts,  Benjamin R. Curtis and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge. The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.
Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator  James W. Grimes that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected  John Schofield as War Secretary.  Kansas Senator  Edmund G. Ross received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal. One reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the  president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a  lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.
With the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted &quot;guilty&quot; and 19 &quot;not guilty&quot;, thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Seven Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull,  William Pitt Fessenden,  Joseph S. Fowler,  John B. Henderson, and  Peter G. Van Winkle—voted to acquit the President. With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the  Republican National Convention; Grant was nominated for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35–19 results. Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings. Stanton &quot;relinquished&quot; his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield. When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.
Allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial. Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held contentious hearings, and issued a report, unendorsed by any other congressman. Butler focused on a New York–based &quot;Astor House Group&quot;, supposedly led by  political boss and editor  Thurlow Weed. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.
Soon after taking office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State  William H. Seward that there would be no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession,  the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in  saber-rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.
Seward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its  North American colony (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron  Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $120 million in present day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited  Wake Island in the Pacific. He came close with the  Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.
Another treaty that fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, negotiated in settlement of the  Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the  United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator  Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.
Johnson appointed nine Article III federal judges during his presidency, all to  United States district courts; he did not appoint a justice to serve on the Supreme Court. In April 1866 he nominated  Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of  John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony,  Samuel Milligan, to the  United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.
Johnson sought nomination by the  1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative  George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor  Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.
The conflict with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.
Seymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.
On Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Davis. He also issued, in his final months in office, pardons for crimes, including one for Dr.  Samuel Mudd, controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination (he had set Booth's broken leg) and imprisoned on Florida's  Dry Tortugas.
On March 3, the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.
After leaving the presidency, Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington, then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.
Some expected Johnson to seek to be Tennessee's governor again or to attempt a return to the Senate, others that he would become a railroad executive. Johnson found Greeneville boring, and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869. Seeking vindication for himself, and revenge against his political enemies, he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home. Tennessee had gone Republican, but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan kept down the African-American vote, leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869. Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election, although hated by Radical Republicans, and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities. Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting, the Republicans eventually elected  Henry Cooper over Johnson, 54–51. In 1872, there was a special election for an  at-large congressional seat for Tennessee; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination, but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general  Benjamin F. Cheatham, decided to run as an independent. The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favour of an old Johnson Unionist ally,  Horace Maynard.
In 1873 Johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000, when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum. He began looking towards the next Senate election, to take place in the legislature in early 1875. Johnson began to woo the farmers'  Grange movement; with his  Jeffersonian leanings, he easily gained their support. He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour. Few African-Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote. Nashville erupted in rejoicing; remarked Johnson, &quot;Thank God for the vindication.&quot;
Johnson's comeback garnered national attention, with the St. Louis Republican calling it, &quot;the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show&quot;. At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with another former vice president, Hamlin, by that office's current incumbent,  Henry Wilson, who as senator had voted for his ouster. Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's  John Sherman (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked, &quot;How far off is military despotism?&quot; and concluded his speech, &quot;may God bless this people and God save the Constitution.&quot;
Johnson returned home after the special session concluded. In late July, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near  Elizabethton, where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he suffered a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the &quot;painful duty&quot; of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville. He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the  Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the  Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.
According to Castel, &quot;historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]&quot;. Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator  James G. Blaine, depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favour the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress. According to historian  Howard K. Beale in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, &quot;Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [Alabama congressman and historian]  Hilary Herbert and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North.&quot;
The turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson. Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian  James Ford Rhodes, who wrote of the former president:
Johnson acted in accordance with his nature. He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove. Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to Congress. The moderate senators and representatives (who constituted a majority of the Union party) asked him for only a slight compromise; their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals ... His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy ... His pride of opinion, his desire to beat, blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country.
Rhodes ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South. Other early 20th-century historians, such as  John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson (who later became president himself) and  William Dunning, all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith. Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson &quot;depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain&quot;.
Even as Rhodes and his school wrote, another group of historians was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary,  Gideon Welles, first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 History of the Reconstruction Period, the author accused Rhodes of being &quot;quite unfair to Johnson&quot;, though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct. A series of highly favorable biographies in the late 1920s and early 1930s that &quot;glorified Johnson and condemned his enemies&quot; accelerated this trend.
Beale wondered in 1940, &quot;is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?&quot; Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time. In 1942,  Van Heflin portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film  Tennessee Johnson. In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian  Arthur M. Schlesinger deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great Chief Executives. Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, &quot;the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote&quot;.
Earlier historians, including Beale, believed that money drives events, and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing  Civil Rights Era as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African-American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as  Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.
In the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes Buchanan the worst president, &quot;Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment ... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy ... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance.&quot; Tolson suggests that &quot;Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans&quot;. Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, &quot;there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice.&quot;
Trefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be &quot;the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come.&quot; Gordon-Reed concludes her account of his life:
We know the results of Johnson's failures—that his preternatural stubbornness, his mean and crude racism, his primitive and instrumental understanding of the Constitution stunted his capacity for enlightened and forward-thinking leadership when those qualities were so desperately needed. At the same time, Johnson's story has a miraculous quality to it: the poor boy who systematically rose to the heights, fell from grace, and then fought his way back to a position of honour. For good or ill, &quot;only in America&quot;, as they say, could Johnson's story unfold in the way that it did.

An actuary is a business professional who deals with the financial impact of  risk and uncertainty. Actuaries provide expert assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms (Trowbridge 1989, p. 7).
Actuaries mathematically evaluate the probability of events and quantify the contingent outcomes in order to minimize financial losses associated with uncertain undesirable events. Since many events, such as death, cannot be avoided, it is helpful to take measures to minimize their financial impact when they occur. These risks can affect both sides of the  balance sheet, and require  asset management,  liability management, and valuation skills. Analytical skills, business knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and the vagaries of information systems are required to design and manage programs that control risk (BeAnActuary 2005a).
The profession has consistently ranked as one of the most desirable in various studies over the years. In 2006, a study by  U.S. News &amp; World Report included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be in great demand in the future (Nemko 2006). In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the No. 1 job in the United States (Needleman 2010). The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands and stress. In 2012, the same study ranked the profession as the second best job (Thomas 2012).
Actuaries'  insurance disciplines include  life;  health;  pensions, annuities, and asset management;  social welfare programs;  property;  casualty;  general insurance; and  reinsurance. Life, health, and pension actuaries deal with  mortality risk, morbidity, and consumer choice regarding the ongoing utilization of drugs and medical services risk, and investment risk. Products prominent in their work include  life insurance,  annuities,  pensions,  mortgage and  credit insurance, short and long term  disability, and  medical, dental,  health savings accounts and  long term care insurance. In addition to these risks,  social insurance programs are greatly influenced by  public opinion, politics, budget constraints, changing  demographics and other factors such as  medical technology, inflation and  cost of living considerations (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009).
Casualty actuaries, also known as non-life or  general insurance actuaries, deal with risks that can occur to people or property other than risks related to the life or health of a person. Products prominent in their work include  auto insurance,  homeowners insurance, commercial property insurance,  workers' compensation,  title insurance,  malpractice insurance,  products liability insurance,  directors and officers liability insurance, environmental and  marine insurance,  terrorism insurance and other types of  liability insurance.  Reinsurance products have to accommodate all of the previously mentioned products, and in addition have to reflect properly the increasing long term risks associated with climate change, cultural litigiousness, acts of war, terrorism and politics (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009).
Both major classes of actuaries are also called upon for their expertise in  enterprise risk management (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009). This can involve  dynamic financial analysis,  stress testing, the formulation of corporate risk policy, and the setting up and running of corporate risk departments (Institute and Faculty of Actuaries 2011b). Actuaries are also involved in other areas of the  financial services industry, and can be involved in managing corporate credit, company evaluations, and tool development (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009).
The basic requirements of communal interests gave rise to risk sharing since the dawn of civilization. For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After basic  exchange came into existence, more complex forms developed beyond a basic  barter economy, and new forms of risk manifested.  Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives.  Intermediaries developed to warehouse and trade goods, and they often suffered from  financial risk. The primary providers in any extended families or household always ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, leaving their dependents to starve.  Credit procurement was difficult if the  lender worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society (Lewin 2007, p. 3).
In the ancient world there was not always room for the sick, suffering, disabled, aged, or the poor—these were often not part of the  cultural consciousness of societies (Perkins 1995). Early methods of protection, aside from the normal support of the extended family, involved charity;  religious organizations or neighbors would collect for the destitute and needy. By the middle of the 3rd century, 1,500 suffering people were being supported by charitable operations in Rome (Perkins 1995). Charitable protection is still an active form of support to this very day (GivingUSA 2009). However, receiving charity is uncertain and is often accompanied by  social stigma. Elementary  mutual aid agreements and pensions did arise in antiquity (Thucydides). Early in the Roman empire, associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to  burial insurance and  friendly societies. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of  columbāria, or burial vaults, owned by the fund—the precursor to  mutual insurance companies (Johnston 1903, §475–§476). Other early examples of mutual  surety and  assurance pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forbears, and to Celtic society (Loan 1992).
Non-life insurance started as a hedge against loss of cargo during sea travel. Anecdotal reports of such guarantees occur in the writings of Demosthenes, who lived in the 4th century BCE (Lewin 2007, pp. 3–4). The earliest records of an official non-life insurance policy come from  Sicily, where there is record of a fourteenth century contract to insure a shipment of wheat (Sweeting 2011, p. 14). In 1350, Lenardo Cattaneo assumed &quot;all risks from act of God, or of man, and from perils of the sea&quot; that may occur to a shipment of wheat from Sicily to Tunis up to a maximum of 300  florins. For this he was paid a premium of eighteen per cent (Lewin 2007, p. 4). In current terminology, this would be an ocean marine contract for a rate-on-line of 18%.
The 17th century was a period of extraordinary advances in mathematics in Germany, France, and England. At the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis. Independently from each other,  compound interest was studied and probability theory emerged as a well understood mathematical discipline. Another important advance came in 1662 from a London  draper named  John Graunt, who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a defined group, or  cohort, of people, despite the uncertainty about the future longevity or mortality of any one individual person. This study became the basis for the original  life table. It was now possible to set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest. The first person to demonstrate publicly how this could be done was Edmond Halley. In addition to constructing his own life table, Halley demonstrated a method of using his life table to calculate the  premium someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life-annuity (Halley 1693).
 James Dodson's pioneering work on the level premium system led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as  Equitable Life) in London in 1762. This was the first life insurance company to use premium rates which were calculated scientifically for long-term life policies, using Dodson's work. The company still exists, though it has run into difficulties recently. After Dodson's death in 1757,  Edward Rowe Mores took over the leadership of the group that eventually became the Society for Equitable Assurances in 1762. It was he who specified that the chief official should be called an 'actuary' (Ogborn 1956, p. 235). Previously, the use of the term had been restricted to an official who recorded the decisions, or 'acts', of ecclesiastical courts, in ancient times originally the secretary of the  Roman senate, responsible for compiling the  Acta Senatus (Ogborn 1956, p. 233). Other companies which did not originally use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable (Bühlmann 1997, p. 166).
In the 18th and 19th centuries, computational complexity was limited to manual calculations. The actual calculations required to compute fair insurance premiums are rather complex. The actuaries of that time developed methods to construct easily used tables, using sophisticated approximations called commutation functions, to facilitate timely, accurate, manual calculations of premiums (Slud 2006). Over time, actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and  actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by ensuring competency and ethical standards (Hickman 2004, p. 4). However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life compatriots in the early 20th century. In the United States, the 1920 revision to workers' compensation rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries (Michelbacher 1920, pp. 224, 230). In the 1930s and 1940s, however, rigorous mathematical foundations for  stochastic processes were developed (Bühlmann 1997, p. 168). Actuaries could now begin to forecast losses using models of random events instead of  deterministic methods. Computers further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to microcomputers, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has grown exponentially (MacGinnitie 1980, pp. 50–51).
Another modern development is the convergence of modern  financial theory with actuarial science (Bühlmann 1997, pp. 169–171). In the early 20th century, actuaries were developing many techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition (Whelan 2002). However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models (D'arcy 1989). Today, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, combines tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory (Feldblum 2001, pp. 8–9), but is still not completely aligned with modern  financial economics (Bader &amp; Gold 2003).
Actuaries use skills in mathematics, economics, computer science, finance, probability and statistics, and business to help businesses assess the risk of certain events occurring and to formulate policies that minimize the cost of that risk. For this reason, actuaries are essential to the insurance and reinsurance industry, either as staff employees or as  consultants; to other businesses, including sponsors of pension plans; and to government agencies such as the  Government Actuary's Department in the UK or the  Social Security Administration in the US. Actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009).
On both the life and casualty sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and reserves for insurance policies covering various risks. Premiums are the amount of money the insurer needs to collect from the policyholder in order to cover the expected losses, expenses, and a provision for profit. Reserves are provisions for future liabilities and indicate how much money should be set aside now to reasonably provide for future payouts. If you inspect the balance sheet of an insurance company, you will find that the liability side consists mainly of reserves.
On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying the probability of a loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. Further, the amount of time that occurs before the loss event is also important, as the insurer will not have to pay anything until after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither of these kinds of analysis are purely  deterministic processes,  stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity  distributions and the  parameters of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side.
Actuaries do not always attempt to predict aggregate future events. Often, their work may relate to determining the cost of financial liabilities that have already occurred, called  retrospective reinsurance, or the development or re-pricing of new products.
Actuaries also design and maintain products and systems. They are involved in financial reporting of companies' assets and liabilities. They must communicate complex concepts to clients who may not share their language or depth of knowledge. Actuaries work under a strict code of ethics that covers their communications and work products, but their clients may not adhere to those same standards when interpreting the data or using it within different kinds of businesses.
Many actuaries are general business managers or financial officers. They analyze business prospects with their financial skills in valuing or discounting risky future cash flows, and many apply their pricing expertise from insurance to other lines of business. Some actuaries act as  expert witnesses by applying their analysis in court trials to estimate the economic value of losses such as lost profits or lost wages.
There has been a recent widening of the scope of the actuarial field to include  investment advice and  asset management. Further, there has been a convergence from the financial fields of  risk management and  quantitative analysis with  actuarial science. Now, actuaries also work as risk managers, quantitative analysts, or investment specialists. Even actuaries in traditional roles are now studying and using the tools and data previously in the domain of finance (Feldblum 2001, p. 8). One of the latest developments in the industry, insurance securitization, requires both the actuarial and finance skills (Krutov 2006).
Another field in which actuaries are becoming more prominent is that of  Enterprise Risk Management, for both financial and non-financial corporations (D'arcy 2005). For example, the  Basel II accord for financial institutions, and its analogue, the  Solvency II accord for insurance companies, requires such institutions to account for  operational risk separately and in addition to  credit,  reserve,  asset, and  insolvency risk. Actuarial skills are well suited to this environment because of their training in analyzing various forms of risk, and judging the potential for upside gain, as well as downside loss associated with these forms of risk (D'arcy 2005).
The credentialing and examination procedure for becoming a fully qualified actuary can be intensely demanding. Consequently, the profession remains very small throughout the world. As a result, actuaries are in high demand, and they are highly paid for the services they render (Ezra 2011). In the UK, where there are approximately 9,000 fully qualified actuaries, typical post-university starting salaries range between GBP £25,300 and £35,000 and successful more experienced actuaries can earn well in excess of £100,000 a year (Lomas 2009).
Becoming a fully credentialed actuary requires passing a rigorous series of professional examinations, usually taking several years in total. In some countries, such as Denmark, most study takes place in a university setting (Norberg 1990, p. 407). In others, such as the U.S., most study takes place during employment through a series of examinations (SOA 2012, CAS 2011). In the UK, and countries based on its process, there is a hybrid university-exam structure (Institute and Faculty of Actuaries 2011a).
As these qualifying exams are rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars designed for the exams (BeAnActuary 2005b). Also, many companies which employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours. A common rule of thumb for exam students is that, for the Society of Actuaries examinations, roughly 400 hours of study time are necessary for each four-hour exam (Sieger 1998). Thus, thousands of hours of study time should be anticipated over several years, assuming no failures (Feldblum 2001, p. 6). In practice, as the historical passing percentages remain below 50% for these exams, the &quot;travel time&quot; to credentialing is extended and more study time is needed. This process resembles formal schooling, so that actuaries who are sitting for exams are still called &quot;students&quot; or &quot;candidates&quot; despite holding important positions with substantial responsibilities.
Due to the low public-profile of the job, some of the most recognizable actuaries to the general public happen to be characters in movies. Many actuaries were unhappy with the stereotypical portrayals of these actuaries as unhappy, math-obsessed and socially inept people; others have claimed that the portrayals are close to home, if a bit exaggerated (Coleman 2003).

Adam Smith (5 June 1723  OS – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish moral philosopher and a pioneer of political economy. One of the key figures of the  Scottish Enlightenment, Adam Smith is best known for two classic works:  The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), and  An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his  magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. Smith is cited as the father of modern economics and is still among the most influential thinkers in the field of economics today. In 2009, Smith was named among the &quot;Greatest Scots&quot; of all time, in a vote run by Scottish television channel  STV.
Smith studied  social philosophy at the  University of Glasgow and at  Balliol College in the University of Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by his fellow  Glaswegian John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the  Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith then returned home and spent the next ten years writing The Wealth of Nations, publishing it in 1776. He died in 1790 at the age of 67.
Smith was born in  Kirkcaldy,  Fife, Scotland. His father, also named Adam Smith, was a  lawyer,  civil servant, and  widower who married Margaret Douglas in 1720 and died two months after Smith was born. Although the exact date of Smith's birth is unknown, his baptism was recorded on 5 June 1723 at Kirkcaldy. Though few events in Smith's early childhood are known, Scottish journalist and Smith's biographer  John Rae recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of four and released when others went to rescue him. Smith was close to his mother, who likely encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions. He attended the  Burgh School of Kirkcaldy—characterised by Rae as &quot;one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period&quot;—from 1729 to 1737. While there, Smith studied Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.
Smith entered the  University of Glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under  Francis Hutcheson. Here, Smith developed his passion for  liberty,  reason, and  free speech. In 1740 Smith was awarded the  Snell exhibition and left to attend  Balliol College, Oxford.
Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling. In Book V, Chapter II of The Wealth of Nations, Smith wrote: &quot;In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.&quot; Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's  Treatise on Human Nature, and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it. According to William Robert Scott, &quot;The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.&quot; Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Oxford library. When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters. Near the end of his time at Oxford, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.
In Book V of The Wealth of Nations, Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at  English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished  men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England.
Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow,  Francis Hutcheson. Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavored not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as &quot;the never to be forgotten Hutcheson&quot;—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in  University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of  Lord Kames. His lecture topics included  rhetoric and  belles-lettres, and later the subject of &quot;the progress of opulence&quot;. On this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of &quot;the obvious and simple system of  natural liberty&quot;. While Smith was not adept at  public speaking, his lectures met with success.
In 1750, he met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.
In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses, and in 1752 Smith was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the  head of Moral Philosophy died the next year, Smith took over the position. He worked as an academic for the next thirteen years, which he characterized as &quot;by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]&quot;.
Smith published  The Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined &quot;mutual sympathy&quot; as the basis of  moral sentiments. He bases his explanation, not on a special &quot;moral sense&quot; as the  Third Lord Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had done, nor on utility as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentieth-century concept of  empathy, the capacity to recognize feelings that are being experienced by another being.
Following the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith. After the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith began to give more attention to  jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals. For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labor, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated  Western European economic policies at the time.
In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of  Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from  Charles Townshend—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson,  Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position, and he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term, but his students refused.
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects – such as proper Polish. He was paid £300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher. Smith first travelled as a tutor to  Toulouse, France, where he stayed for one and a half years. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he &quot;had begun to write a book to pass away the time&quot;. After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire.
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here Smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time; invariably having an effect on his future works. This list included: Benjamin Franklin,  Turgot,  Jean D'Alembert,  André Morellet,  Helvétius, and, notably,  François Quesnay, the head of the  Physiocratic school. So impressed with his ideas Smith considered dedicating The Wealth of Nations to him – had Quesnay not died beforehand. Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism, the dominating economic theory of the time. Illustrated in their motto  Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même! (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!). They were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth; merchants and industrialists (manufacturers) did not. This however, did not represent their true school of thought, but was a mere &quot;smoke screen&quot; manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church; arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants and manufacturers. The wealth of France was virtually destroyed by Louis XIV and  Louis XV to ruinous wars, by aiding the American insurgents against the British, and perhaps most destructive (in terms of public perceptions) was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution –  unproductive labour. Assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth, the feudal system of agriculture in France was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation. Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of Physiocrats were, &quot;with all [their] imperfections [perhaps], the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy&quot;. The distinction between productive versus  unproductive labour – the physiocratic classe steril – was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter. Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus. There he befriended  Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. As well as teaching Moyes, Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and  Thomas Reid in the young man's education. In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the  Royal Society of London, and was elected a member of the  Literary Club in 1775.  The Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.
In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in  Panmure House in Edinburgh's  Canongate. Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the  Royal Society of Edinburgh, and from 1787 to 1789 he occupied the honorary position of Lord  Rector of the University of Glasgow. He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness and was buried in the  Canongate Kirkyard. On his death bed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.
Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist  Joseph Black, and the pioneering geologist  James Hutton. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as  Essays on Philosophical Subjects.
Smith's library went by his will to  David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Rev. W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor  Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879 her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church), Edinburgh.
Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request. He never married, and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before his own death.
Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of &quot;inexpressible benignity&quot;. He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a  tanning factory, and while discussing  free trade, Smith walked into a huge  tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up 15 miles (24 km) outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.
 James Boswell who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the  Literary Club, says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, and so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told  Sir Joshua Reynolds that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.
Smith, who is reported to have been an odd-looking fellow, has been described as someone who &quot;had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment&quot;. Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, &quot;I am a beau in nothing but my books.&quot; Smith rarely sat for portraits, so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by  James Tassie and two  etchings by  John Kay. The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th century reprints of The Wealth of Nations were based largely on Tassie's medallion.
There has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the  Church of Scotland. The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England. It is generally believed that at Oxford Smith rejected Christianity, returning to Scotland a  deist.
Anglo-American economist  Ronald Coase has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the &quot; Great Architect of the Universe&quot;, later scholars such as  Jacob Viner have &quot;very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God&quot;, a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the Wealth of Nations in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the &quot;great phenomena of nature&quot;, such as &quot;the generation, the life, growth and dissolution of plants and animals&quot;, has led men to &quot;enquire into their causes&quot;, and that &quot;superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods&quot;.
Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume, who was commonly characterized in his own time as an atheist. The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to  William Strahan, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.
In 1759, Smith published his first work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. He continued making extensive revisions to the book, up until his death. Although The Wealth of Nations is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, it is believed that Smith himself considered The Theory of Moral Sentiments to be a superior work.
In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from social relationships. His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgements, in spite of man's natural inclinations towards self-interest. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behaviour.
Scholars have traditionally perceived a conflict between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations; the former emphasizes sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the &quot;impartial spectator&quot; as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathize with them. Rather than viewing The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasizing different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation.
These views ignore that Smith's visit to France (1764–66) changed radically his former views and that The Wealth of Nations is an inhomogeneous convolute of his former lectures and of what  Quesnay taught him. Before his voyage to France in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith refers to an &quot;invisible hand&quot; (&quot;By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, [an individual] intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other eases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.&quot;)  which ensures that the gluttony of the rich helps the poor, as the stomachs of rich are so limited that they have to spend their fortune on servants. After his visit to France, Smith considers in the Wealth of Nations (1776) the gluttony of the rich as  unproductive labour. The micro-economical/psychological view in the tradition of Aristotle,  Puffendorf and  Hutcheson, Smith's teacher—elements compatible with a neoclassical theory—changed to the macroeconomic view of the classical theory Smith learned in France.
There is a fundamental disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's  invisible hand, a concept mentioned in the middle of his work—Book IV, Chapter II—and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the &quot;wealth of nations&quot; in the first sentences.
Smith used the term &quot; the invisible hand&quot; in &quot;History of Astronomy&quot; referring to &quot;the invisible hand of Jupiter&quot; and twice—each time with a different meaning—the term &quot; an invisible hand&quot;: in  The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and in The Wealth of Nations (1776). This last statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;the invisible hand&quot; in numerous ways. It is therefore important to read the original:
As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other eases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.
Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.
Smith's statement about the benefits of &quot;an invisible hand&quot; is certainly meant to answer  Mandeville's contention that &quot;Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits&quot;. It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest, he indirectly promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their &quot;conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices&quot;. Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price &quot;which can be squeezed out of the buyers&quot;. Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants &quot;...in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public...The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.&quot;
The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of  neoclassical economics and its  General Equilibrium concept.  Samuelson's &quot;Economics&quot; refers 6 times to Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot;. To emphasize this relation, Samuelson quotes Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot; statement putting &quot;general interest&quot; where Smith wrote &quot;publick interest&quot;. Samuelson concluded: &quot;Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.&quot;
Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. Taking up the  physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1. Therefore the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as  unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had learned in France with  Quesnay. To this French insight that  unproductive labour should be pushed back to use more labour productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the  division of labour. Deepening the division of labour means under competition lower prices and thereby extended markets. Extended markets and increased production lead to a new step of reorganising production and inventing new ways of producing which again lower prices, etc., etc.. Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. It predicted England's evolution as the workshop of the World, underselling all its competitors. The opening sentences of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; summarize this policy:
The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
Prominent interpretation, as well as criticism, of Smith's views on the societal merits of unregulated labor management by the ruling class is expressed by Noam Chomsky as follows: &quot;He's pre-capitalist, a figure of the Enlightenment. What we would call capitalism he despised. People read snippets of Adam Smith, the few phrases they teach in school. Everybody reads the first paragraph of The Wealth of Nations where he talks about how wonderful the division of labor is. But not many people get to the point hundreds of pages later, where he says that division of labor will destroy human beings and turn people into creatures as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human being to be. And therefore in any civilized society the government is going to have to take some measures to prevent division of labor from proceeding to its limits.&quot;
Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published Essays on Philosophical Subjects, a history of astronomy down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on ancient physics and  metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise.  Lectures on Jurisprudence were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of The Wealth of Nations, published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763) (first published in 1896); and Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795).
The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirized by  Tory writers in the moralizing tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it is said, used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag.
In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantalism began to decline in England in the late 18th century. During the Industrial Revolution, Britain embraced free trade and Smith's laissez-faire economics, and via the British Empire, used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterized by open markets, and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade.
 George Stigler attributes to Smith &quot;the most important substantive proposition in all of economics&quot;. It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labor, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in  equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.
 Paul Samuelson finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the  general equilibrium modeling of  Walras a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention added a realism missed later by Malthus, Ricardo, and Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.
On the other hand,  Joseph Schumpeter dismissed Smith's contributions as unoriginal, saying &quot;His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.&quot;
Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the &quot; labour theory of value&quot;. Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, Capital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labor that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern understanding of  mainstream economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.
The body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; or &quot; marginalism&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularized by such neoclassical economists as  Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for &quot;economic science&quot; and a substitute for the earlier, broader term &quot;political economy&quot; used by Smith. This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the  natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematized supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the  labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a  marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.
The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of The Wealth of Nations was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for The Theory of Moral Sentiments and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His  homo economicus or &quot;economic man&quot; was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in &quot;The Secret History of the Dismal Science&quot; point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasized also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The “Vanity of the Philosopher”: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher, and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.
Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:
&quot;Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.&quot; (Source: The Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)
Adam Smith resided at Panmure house from 1778-90. This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot Watt University and fundraising has begun to restore it. Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.
Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the  Adam Smith Institute in London, the Adam Smith Society and the Australian Adam Smith Club, and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.
 Alan Greenspan argues that, while Smith did not coin the term  laissez-faire, &quot;it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions&quot;. Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was &quot;one of the great achievements in human intellectual history&quot;.  P. J. O'Rourke describes Smith as the &quot;founder of free market economics&quot;.
However, other writers have argued that Smith's support for laissez-faire (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated.  Herbert Stein wrote that the people who &quot;wear an Adam Smith necktie&quot; do it to &quot;make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and  limited government&quot;, and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith &quot;was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.&quot; In Stein's reading, The Wealth of Nations could justify the  Food and Drug Administration, the  Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits,  environmentalism, and &quot; discriminatory taxation to deter  improper or  luxurious behaviour&quot;.
Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in  The Economic Journal that in the 20th century United States,  Reaganomics supporters, the Wall Street Journal, and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an &quot;extreme dogmatic defender of  laissez-faire capitalism and  supply-side economics&quot;. In fact, The Wealth of Nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:
&quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.&quot;
Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them  luxury goods taxes and tax on rent.
Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defense and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods &quot;of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual&quot; such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. he supported public education and religious institutions as providing general benefit to the society. Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because &quot;we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a  doge&quot;. In addition, he was in favour of retaliatory tariffs and believed that they would eventually bring down the price of goods. He even stated in Wealth of Nations:
&quot;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.&quot;
Noam Chomsky has argued that several aspects of Smith's thought have been misrepresented and falsified by contemporary ideology, including Smith's reasons for supporting markets and Smith's views on corporations. Chomsky argues that Smith supported markets in the belief that they would lead to equality, and that Smith opposed wage labor and corporations.  Economic historians such as  Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called &quot;natural liberty&quot;) but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissez-faire.
Economist  Daniel Klein believes using the term &quot;free market economics&quot; or &quot;free market economist&quot; to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the &quot;Smithian&quot; identity. Economist  David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defense. Some have also claimed,  Emma Rothschild among them, that Smith supported a minimum wage.
Though, Smith had written in his book The Wealth of Nations:
&quot;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so.&quot; (Source: The Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 8)

Behavioural economics and behavioural finance are closely related fields which apply scientific research on human and social cognitive and emotional  biases to better understand  economic  decisions and how they affect  market prices,  returns and the  allocation of resources. The fields are primarily concerned with the  rationality, or lack thereof, of  economic agents.  Behavioural models typically integrate insights from psychology with  neo-classical economic theory.
Academics are divided between considering Behavioural Finance as supporting some tools of  technical analysis by explaining market trends, and considering some aspects of technical analysis as behavioural biases ( representativeness heuristic, self fulfilling prophecy).
Behavioural analysts are mostly concerned with the effects of market decisions, but also those of  public choice, another source of economic decisions with some similar biases.
During the  classical period, economics had a close link with psychology. For example, Adam Smith wrote  The Theory of Moral Sentiments, an important text describing psychological principles of individual behaviour; and Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of  utility. Economists began to distance themselves from psychology during the development of neo-classical economics as they sought to reshape the discipline as a  natural science, with explanations of economic behaviour deduced from assumptions about the nature of economic agents. The concept of  homo economicus was developed, and the psychology of this entity was fundamentally rational. Nevertheless, psychological explanations continued to inform the analysis of many important figures in the development of neo-classical economics such as  Francis Edgeworth,  Vilfredo Pareto,  Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes.
Psychology had largely disappeared from economic discussions by the mid 20th century. A number of factors contributed to the resurgence of its use and the development of behavioural economics.  Expected utility and  discounted utility models began to gain wide acceptance, generating testable  hypotheses about decision making under  uncertainty and  intertemporal consumption respectively. Soon a number of observed and repeatable anomalies challenged those hypotheses. Furthermore, during the 1960s  cognitive psychology began to describe the brain as an information processing device (in contrast to  behaviorist models). Psychologists in this field such as Ward Edwards,  Amos Tversky and  Daniel Kahneman began to compare their cognitive models of decision making under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behaviour. In  Mathematical psychology, there is a longstanding interest in the transitivity of preference and what kind of measurement scale utility constitutes ( Luce, 2000).
An important paper in the development of the behavioural finance and economics fields was written by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979. This paper, ' Prospect theory: Decision Making Under Risk', used cognitive psychological techniques to explain a number of documented divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theory. Over time many other psychological effects have been incorporated into behavioral finance, such as overconfidence and the effects of limited attention. Further milestones in the development of the field include a well attended and diverse conference at the University of Chicago, a special 1997 edition of the Quarterly Journal of Economics ('In Memory of Amos Tversky') devoted to the topic of behavioural economics and the award of the  Nobel prize to Daniel Kahneman in 2002 &quot;for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty&quot;.
Prospect theory is an example of  generalized expected utility theory. Although not commonly included in discussions of the field of behavioural economics, generalized expected utility theory is similarly motivated by concerns about the descriptive inaccuracy of  expected utility theory.
Behavioural economics has also been applied to problems of intertemporal choice. The most prominent idea is that of  hyperbolic discounting, proposed by George Ainslie (1975), in which a high rate of discount is used between the present and the near future, and a lower rate between the near future and the far future. This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with some models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time t and t+1 will be low at time t-1, when t is the near future, but high at time t when t is the present and time t+1 the near future. As part of the discussion of hypberbolic discounting, has been animal and human work on  Melioration theory and  Matching Law of  Richard Herrnstein. They suggest that behaviour is not based on expected utility rather it is based on previous  reinforcement experience.
At the outset behavioural economics and finance theories were developed almost exclusively from experimental observations and survey responses, though in more recent times real world data has taken a more prominent position.  fMRI has also been used to determine which areas of the brain are active during various steps of economic decision making. Experiments simulating market situations such as stock market trading and  auctions are seen as particularly useful as they can be used to isolate the effect of a particular bias upon behavior; observed market behaviour can typically be explained in a number of ways, carefully designed experiments can help narrow the range of plausible explanations. Experiments are designed to be incentive compatible, with binding transactions involving real money the norm.
There are three main themes in behavioural finance and economics:
Recently, Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), as well as Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) have built models based on extrapolation (seeing patterns in random sequences) and overconfidence to explain security market over- and underreactions, though such models have not been used in the money management industry. These models assume that errors or biases are correlated across agents so that they do not cancel out in aggregate. This would be the case if a large fraction of agents look at the same signal (such as the advice of an analyst) or have a common bias.
More generally, cognitive biases may also have strong anomalous effects in aggregate if there is a social contamination with a strong emotional content (collective greed or fear), leading to more widespread phenomena such as  herding and  groupthink. Behavioural finance and economics rests as much on  social psychology within large groups as on individual psychology. However, some behavioural models explicitly demonstrate that a small but significant anomalous group can also have market-wide effects (eg. Fehr and Schmidt, 1999).
Some central issues in behavioural finance are why investors and managers (and also lenders and borrowers) make systematic errors. It shows how those errors affect prices and returns (creating market inefficiencies). It shows also what managers of firms or other institutions, as well as other financial players might do to take advantage of market inefficiencies.
Among the inefficiencies described by behavioural finance, underreactions or overreactions to information are often cited, as causes of  market trends and in extreme cases of  bubbles and  crashes). Such misreactions have been attributed to limited investor attention, overconfidence / overoptimism, and mimicry ( herding instinct) and noise trading.
Other key observations made in behavioural finance literature include the lack of symmetry between decisions to acquire or keep resources, called colloquially the &quot;bird in the bush&quot; paradox, and the strong  loss aversion or regret attached to any decision where some emotionally valued resources (e.g. a home) might be totally lost. Loss aversion appears to manifest itself in investor behaviour as an unwillingness to sell shares or other equity, if doing so would force the trader to realise a nominal loss (Genesove &amp; Mayer, 2001). It may also help explain why housing market prices do not adjust downwards to market clearing levels during periods of low demand.
Applying a version of  prospect theory, Benartzi and Thaler (1995) claim to have solved the  equity premium puzzle, something conventional finance models have been unable to do.
Presently, some researchers in  experimental finance use experimental method, e.g. creating an artificial market by some kind of simulation software to study people's decision-making process and behaviour in financial markets.
Some financial models used in money management and asset valuation use behavioural finance parameters, for example:
Critics of behavioural finance, such as  Eugene Fama, typically support the  efficient market theory (though Fama may have reversed his position in recent years). They contend that behavioural finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies will eventually be priced out of the market or explained by appealing to  market microstructure arguments. However, a distinction should be noted between individual biases and social biases; the former can be averaged out by the market, while the other can create  feedback loops that drive the market further and further from the equilibrium of the &quot; fair price&quot;.
A specific example of this criticism is found in some attempted explanations of the  equity premium puzzle. It is argued that the puzzle simply arises due to  entry barriers (both practical and psychological) which have traditionally impeded entry by individuals into the stock market, and that returns between stocks and bonds should stabilize as electronic resources open up the stock market to a greater number of traders (See Freeman, 2004 for a review). In reply, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, so the effect of these putative barriers to entry would be minimal. In addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials.
 Quantitative behavioral finance is a new discipline that uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioural biases in conjunction with valuation. Some of this endeavor has been lead by  Gunduz Caginalp (Professor of Mathematics and Editor of  Journal of Behavioural Finance during 2001-2004) and collaborators including  Vernon Smith (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics), David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran, Huseyin Merdan). Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant behavioural effects in stocks and exchange traded funds.
The research can be grouped into the following areas:
Critics of behavioural economics typically stress the  rationality of economic agents (see Myagkov and Plott (1997) amongst others). They contend that experimentally observed behavior is inapplicable to market situations, as learning opportunities and competition will ensure at least a close approximation of rational behaviour.
Others note that cognitive theories, such as  prospect theory, are models of  decision making, not generalized economic behaviour, and are only applicable to the sort of once-off decision problems presented to experiment participants or survey respondents.
Traditional economists are also skeptical of the experimental and survey based techniques which are used extensively in behavioural economics. Economists typically stress  revealed preferences over stated preferences (from surveys) in the determination of economic value. Experiments and surveys must be designed carefully to avoid systemic biases, strategic behaviour and lack of incentive compatibility, and many economists are distrustful of results obtained in this manner due to the difficulty of eliminating these problems.
Rabin (1998) dismisses these criticisms, claiming that results are typically reproduced in various situations and countries and can lead to good theoretical insight. Behavioural economists have also incorporated these criticisms by focusing on field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists look at this split as a fundamental schism between  experimental economics and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to overlap techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, many prominent behavioural economists are actively investigating  neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and cannot be verified in the field.
Other proponents of behavioral economics note that neoclassical models often fail to predict outcomes in real world contexts. Behavioral insights can be used to update neoclassical equations, and behavioural economists note that these revised models not only reach the same correct predictions as the traditional models, but also correctly predict some outcomes where the traditional models failed.

Alice Stokes Paul (January 11, 1885 – July 9, 1977) was an American  suffragist leader. Along with  Lucy Burns (a close friend) and others, she led a successful campaign for  women's suffrage that resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.
Paul was born into a Quaker family at  Paulsdale, in  Mount Laurel,  New Jersey. She was the first-born child of William Mickle Paul I (1850-1902), and Tacie Parry. William was a banker and businessman. He served as president of the Burlington County Trust Company. Alice had two brothers, William Mickle Paul II (1886-1958), Parry Haines Paul, and a sister, Helen Paul (1889-1961). 
In 1901, she graduated first in her class from the  Moorestown Friends School. She later attended  Swarthmore College (BA, 1905), the  New York School of Philanthropy (social work), and the  University of Pennsylvania (MA, sociology). In 1907, Paul moved to England where she attended the  University of Birmingham and the  London School of Economics (LSE). Returning to the U.S. in 1910, she attended the  University of Pennsylvania, completing a PhD in political science in 1912. Her dissertation topic was: The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania. In 1927, she received an  LLM followed by a Doctor of Civil Law degree in 1928, both from  American University's  Washington College of Law.
While she was in England in 1908, Paul heard  Christabel Pankhurst speak at the University of Birmingham. Inspired, Paul joined the  Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), where she met fellow American Lucy Burns. Her activities with the WSPU led to her arrest and imprisonment three times. Along with other suffragists she went on a  hunger strike and was force-fed.
In 1912, Alice Paul joined the  National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and was appointed Chairman of their Congressional Committee in Washington, DC. After months of fundraising and raising awareness for the cause, membership numbers went up and, in 1913, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns formed the Congressional Union for Women Suffrage. Their focus was lobbying for a  constitutional amendment to secure the right to vote for women. Such an amendment had originally been sought by suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1878. However, by the early 20th century, attempts to secure a federal amendment had ceased. The focus of the suffrage movement had turned to securing the vote on a state-by-state basis.
When their lobbying efforts proved fruitless, Paul and her colleagues formed the  National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916 and began introducing some of the methods used by the suffrage movement in Britain. Tactics included demonstrations, parades, mass meetings, picketing, suffrage watch, fires, and hunger strikes. These actions were accompanied by press coverage and the publication of the weekly Suffragist.
In the election of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent  Democrats to support the Suffrage Amendment actively. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest to  picket the  White House. The picketers, known as &quot;Silent Sentinels,&quot; held banners demanding the right to vote. This was an example of a  non-violent  civil disobedience campaign. In July 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of &quot;obstructing traffic.&quot; Many, including Paul, were convicted, incarcerated and tortured at the  Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (later the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail.
In protest of the conditions in Occoquan, Paul commenced a hunger strike. This led to her being moved to the prison’s psychiatric ward and force-fed raw eggs through a plastic tube. Other women joined the strike, which combined with the continuing demonstrations and attendant press coverage, kept the pressure on the Wilson administration. In January, 1918, the president announced that women's suffrage was urgently needed as a &quot;war measure.&quot; Wilson strongly urged Congress to pass the legislation. In 1920, after coming down to one vote in the state of Tennessee, the  Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution secured the vote for women.
Paul was the original author of a proposed  Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution in 1923. She opposed linking the ERA to  abortion rights, as did most early feminists. It has been widely reported that Paul called abortion &quot;the ultimate exploitation of women.&quot; There has been a suggestion that although she did not want the ERA to be linked with abortion, it was for political, rather than ideological or moral, reasons. An article in  pro-choice publication The Touchstone (2000) provides the following commentary on the relationship between the ERA and her views on abortion:
Alice Paul did oppose the linkage between the ERA and abortion, but that was because of her political astuteness rather than any disagreement with abortion. Paul felt that by linking the ERA with abortion, the ERA would not pass through Congress. Willis wrote, &quot;She did not address issues of birth control, i.e., abortion, or even women's sexuality, and was concerned that the radical women of the 1960s might alienate support by emphasizing these issues...[S]he said that even if women did want to do many things that she wished they would not do with their freedom, it was not her business to tell them what to do with it, but to see that they had it.&quot; This demonstrates that Alice Paul supported equal rights for women, including the right to choose abortion...
This article however directly conflicts with a statement published by  right-to-life activist Mary Meehan, from an interview with a colleague of Paul's:
When I worked with Alice Paul I asked her about the abortion question — point blank. She said directly, &quot;Abortion is just another way of exploiting women.&quot; Then she went on to explain that the National Woman's Party was organized for the benefit of women. Killing female babies was no way to benefit or protect women.
The ERA would not find its way to the Senate until 1972, when it was approved by the Senate and submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. Approval by 38 states was required to ensure adoption of the amendment. Not enough states — only 35 — voted in favour.
In 1929, she became the primary resident for 40 years of a house bought by  Alva Belmont, located in the  Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington, D.C., for the NWP headquarters. The house is now known as the  Sewall-Belmont House and Museum and is a historic house and museum of the U.S. women's suffrage and equal-rights movements.
Alice Paul died on July 9, 1977 at the  Quaker Greenleaf Extension Home in  Moorestown Township, New Jersey, near her family home of Paulsdale, at the age of 92.
Alice Paul has created a long legacy of woman’s rights. Her portrait was placed on an English postage stamp in 1981. She was portrayed by  Hilary Swank in the  HBO 2004 movie  Iron Jawed Angels.
There is a dormitory at Swarthmore College named in her honour.

Amnesty International (commonly known as Amnesty and AI) is a non-governmental organisation focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The objective of the organisation is &quot;to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.&quot;
Amnesty International was founded in London in 1961, following the publication of the article &quot; The Forgotten Prisoners&quot; in  The Observer 28 May 1961, by the lawyer  Peter Benenson. Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilise  public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organisation was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its &quot;campaign against  torture,&quot; and the  United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.
In the field of international human rights organisations, Amnesty has the longest history and broadest name recognition, and &quot;is believed by many to set standards for the movement as a whole.&quot;
Amnesty International was founded in London in July 1961 by English labour lawyer  Peter Benenson. According to his own account, he was travelling in the London Underground on 19 November 1960, when he read of two Portuguese students from  Coimbra who had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in Portugal for allegedly &quot;having drunk a toast to liberty&quot;. Researchers have never traced the alleged newspaper article in question. In 1960, Portugal was ruled by the  Estado Novo government of  António de Oliveira Salazar. The government was authoritarian in nature and strongly  anti-communist, supressing enemies of the state as anti-Portuguese. In his significant newspaper article &quot; The Forgotten Prisoners&quot;, Benenson later described his reaction as follows: &quot;Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government [...] The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust could be united into common action, something effective could be done.&quot;
Benenson worked with friend  Eric Baker. Baker was a member of the Religious Society of Friends who had been involved in funding the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as well as becoming head of  Quaker Peace and Social Witness, and in his memoirs Benenson described him as &quot;a partner in the launching of the project&quot;. In consultation with other writers, academics and lawyers and, in particular,  Alec Digges, they wrote via  Louis Blom-Cooper to  David Astor, editor of  The Observer newspaper, who, on 28 May 1961, published Benenson's article &quot; The Forgotten Prisoners&quot;. The article brought the reader's attention to those &quot;imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government&quot; or, put another way, to violations, by governments, of articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The article described these violations occurring, on a global scale, in the context of restrictions to press freedom, to political oppositions, to timely  public trial before impartial courts, and to asylum. It marked the launch of &quot;Appeal for Amnesty, 1961&quot;, the aim of which was to mobilise public opinion, quickly and widely, in defence of these individuals, whom Benenson named &quot;Prisoners of Conscience&quot;. The &quot;Appeal for Amnesty&quot; was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers. In the same year Benenson had a book published, Persecution 1961, which detailed the cases of nine  prisoners of conscience investigated and compiled by Benenson and Baker ( Maurice Adin,  Ashton Jones,  Agostinho Neto,  Patrick Duncan,  Olga Ivinskaya,  Luis Taruc,  Constantin Noica,  Antonio Amat and  Hu Feng). In July 1961 the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organisation, Amnesty, with the first meeting taking place in London. Benenson ensured that all three major political parties were represented, enlisting Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and  the Liberal Party. On 30 September 1962, it was officially named 'Amnesty International'. Between the 'Appeal for Amnesty, 1961' and September 1962 the organisation had been known simply as 'Amnesty'.
What started as a short appeal soon became a permanent international movement working to protect those imprisoned for non-violent expression of their views and to secure worldwide recognition of Articles 18 and 19 of the UDHR. From the very beginning, research and campaigning were present in Amnesty International's work. A library was established for information about prisoners of conscience and a network of local groups, called 'THREES' groups, was started. Each group worked on behalf of three prisoners, one from each of the then three main ideological regions of the world:  communist,  capitalist and  developing.
By the mid-1960s Amnesty International's global presence was growing and an International Secretariat and International Executive Committee were established to manage Amnesty International's national organisations, called 'Sections', which had appeared in several countries. The international movement was starting to agree on its core principles and techniques. For example, the issue of whether or not to adopt prisoners who had advocated violence, like Nelson Mandela, brought unanimous agreement that it could not give the name of 'Prisoner of Conscience' to such prisoners. Aside from the work of the library and groups, Amnesty International's activities were expanding to helping prisoners' families, sending observers to trials, making representations to governments, and finding asylum or overseas employment for prisoners. Its activity and influence were also increasing within intergovernmental organisations; it would be awarded consultative status by the United Nations, the  Council of Europe and UNESCO before the decade ended.
Leading Amnesty International in the 1970s were key figureheads  Seán MacBride and  Martin Ennals. While continuing to work for prisoners of conscience, Amnesty International's purview widened to include &quot; fair trial&quot; and opposition to long  detention without trial (UDHR Article 9), and especially to the torture of prisoners (UDHR Article 5). Amnesty International believed that the reasons underlying torture of prisoners by governments, were either to acquire and obtain information or to quell opposition by the use of terror, or both. Also of concern was the export of more sophisticated torture methods, equipment and teaching by the superpowers to &quot;client states&quot;, for example by the United States through  some activities of the CIA.
Amnesty International drew together reports from countries where torture allegations seemed most persistent and organised an international conference on torture. It sought to influence public opinion in order to put pressure on national governments by organising a campaign for the 'Abolition of Torture' which ran for several years.
Amnesty International's membership increased from 15,000 in 1969 to 200,000 by 1979. This growth in resources enabled an expansion of its program, 'outside of the prison walls', to include work on  &quot;disappearances&quot;, the  death penalty and the rights of refugees. A new technique, the 'Urgent Action', aimed at mobilising the membership into action rapidly was pioneered. The first was issued on 19 March 1973, on behalf of Luiz Basilio Rossi, a Brazilian academic, arrested for political reasons.
At the intergovernmental level Amnesty International pressed for application of the UN's  Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and of existing humanitarian conventions; to secure ratifications of the two  UN Covenants on Human Rights in 1976); and was instrumental in obtaining additional instruments and provisions forbidding its practice. Consultative status was granted at the  Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1972.
In 1976 Amnesty's British Section started a series of fund-raising events that came to be known as  The Secret Policeman's Balls series. They were staged in London initially as comedy galas featuring what the Daily Telegraph called &quot;the crème de la crème of the British comedy world&quot; including members of comedy troupe Monty Python, and later expanded to also include performances by leading rock musicians. The series was created and developed by Monty Python alumnus  John Cleese and entertainment industry executive  Martin Lewis working closely with Amnesty staff members  Peter Luff (Assistant Director of Amnesty 1974–1978) and subsequently with Peter Walker (Amnesty Fund-Raising Officer 1978–1982). Cleese, Lewis and Luff worked together on the first two shows (1976 and 1977). Cleese, Lewis and Walker worked together on the 1979 and 1981 shows, the first to carry what the Daily Telegraph described as the &quot;rather brilliantly re-christened&quot; Secret Policeman's Ball title.
The organisation was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its &quot;campaign against  torture&quot; and the  United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.
By 1980 Amnesty International was drawing more criticism from governments. The USSR alleged that Amnesty International conducted espionage, the Moroccan government denounced it as a defender of lawbreakers, and the Argentine government banned Amnesty International's 1983 annual report.
Throughout the 1980s, Amnesty International continued to campaign against torture, and on behalf of prisoners of conscience. New issues emerged, including  extrajudicial killings, military, security and police transfers, political killings; and disappearances.
Towards the end of the decade, the growing number of refugees worldwide was a very visible area of Amnesty International's concern. While many of the world's refugees of the time had been displaced by war and famine, in adherence to its mandate, Amnesty International concentrated on those forced to flee because of the human rights violations it was seeking to prevent. It argued that rather than focusing on new restrictions on entry for asylum-seekers, governments were to address the human rights violations which were forcing people into exile.
Apart from a second campaign on torture during the first half of the decade, two major musical events occurred, designed to increase awareness of Amnesty and of human rights (particularly among younger generations) during the mid- to late-1980s. The 1986  Conspiracy of Hope tour, which played five concerts in the U.S., and culminated in a daylong show, featuring some thirty-odd acts at Giants Stadium, and the 1988  Human Rights Now! world tour. Human Rights Now!, which was timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), played a series of concerts on five continents over six weeks. Both tours featured some of the most famous musicians and bands of the day.
Throughout the 1990s, Amnesty International continued to grow, to a membership of over 3 million in over 150 countries and territories, led by Senegalese Secretary General  Pierre Sané. Amnesty continued to work on a wide range of issues and world events. For example, South African groups joined in 1992 and hosted a visit by Pierre Sané to meet with the apartheid government to press for an investigation into allegations of police abuse, an end to arms sales to the African Great Lakes region and the abolition of the death penalty. In particular, Amnesty International brought attention to violations committed on specific groups, including  refugees, racial/ethnic/religious minorities, women and those executed or on  Death Row. The death penalty report When the state kills ( ISBN 978-0-691-10261-0) and the 'Human Rights are Women's Rights' campaign were key actions for the latter two issues. During the 1990s, Amnesty International was forced to react to human rights violations occurring in the context of a proliferation of armed conflict in Angola, East Timor, the Persian Gulf, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia. Amnesty International took no position on whether to support or oppose external military interventions in these armed conflicts. It did not (and does not) reject the use of force, even lethal force, or ask those engaged to lay down their arms. Instead, it questioned the motives behind external intervention and selectivity of international action in relation to the strategic interests of those sending troops. It argued that action should be taken to prevent human rights problems becoming human rights catastrophes, and that both intervention and inaction represented a failure of the  international community.
In 1995, when AI wanted to promote how Shell Oil Company was involved with the execution of an environmental and human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria, it was stopped. Newspapers and advertising companies refused to run AI’s ads because Shell Oil was a customer of theirs as well. Shell’s main argument was that it was drilling oil in a country that already violated human rights and had no way to enforce human rights policies. To combat the buzz that AI was trying to create, it immediately publicized how Shell was helping to improve overall life in Nigeria. Salil Shetty, the director of Amnesty, said, &quot;Social media re-energises the idea of the global citizen&quot;. James M. Russell notes how the drive for profit from private media sources conflicts with the stories that AI wants to be heard.
Amnesty International was proactive in pushing for recognition of the universality of human rights. The campaign 'Get Up, Sign Up' marked 50 years of the UDHR. Thirteen million pledges were collected in support, and the Decl music concert was held in Paris on 10 December 1998 ( Human Rights Day). At the intergovernmental level, Amnesty International argued in favour of creating an  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (established 1993) and an  International Criminal Court (established 2002).
After his arrest in London in 1998 by the  Metropolitan Police, Amnesty International became involved in the legal battle of Senator Pinochet, a former Chilean President, who sought to avoid extradition to Spain to face charges.  Lord Hoffman had an indirect connection with Amnesty International, and this led to an important test for the appearance of bias in legal proceedings in UK law. There was a suit against the decision to release Senator Pinochet, taken by the then British  Home Secretary Mr Jack Straw, before that decision had actually been taken, in an attempt to prevent the release of Senator Pinochet. The English High Court refused the application and Senator Pinochet was released and returned to Chile. This legal challenge was a novel attempt to use legal process to challenge a decision before it was taken and could be seen as hard to reconcile with the  rule of law, as it was predicated on a presumption that the Home Secretary had erred in law whatever the reasons were for the decision.
After 2000, Amnesty International's agenda turned to the challenges arising from globalisation and the reaction to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. The issue of globalisation provoked a major shift in Amnesty International policy, as the scope of its work was widened to include economic, social and cultural rights, an area that it had declined to work on in the past. Amnesty International felt this shift was important, not just to give credence to its principle of the indivisibility of rights, but because of what it saw as the growing power of companies and the undermining of many nation states as a result of globalisation.
In the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, the new Amnesty International Secretary General,  Irene Khan, reported that a senior government official had said to Amnesty International delegates: &quot;Your role collapsed with the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York&quot;. In the years following the attacks, some believe that the gains made by human rights organisations over previous decades had possibly been eroded. Amnesty International argued that human rights were the basis for the security of all, not a barrier to it. Criticism came directly from the  Bush administration and The Washington Post, when Khan, in 2005, likened the US government's detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to a  Soviet Gulag.
During the first half of the new decade, Amnesty International turned its attention to  violence against women, controls on the world  arms trade, concerns surrounding the effectiveness of the UN, and ending torture. With its membership close to two million by 2005, Amnesty continued to work for prisoners of conscience.
In 2007, AI's executive committee decided to support access to abortion &quot;within reasonable gestational limits...for women in cases of rape, incest or violence, or where the pregnancy jeopardizes a mother’s life or health&quot;.
Amnesty International reported, concerning the Iraq War, on 17 March 2008, that despite claims the security situation in Iraq has improved in recent months, the human rights situation is disastrous, after the start of the war five years ago in 2003.
In 2008 Amnesty International launched a  mobile donating campaign in the United States, which allows supporters to make $5  micro-donations by sending a text message to the  short code 90999 with the keyword RIGHTS. Amnesty International's mobile fund raising campaign was created in partnership with  Mgive and the  Mobile Giving Foundation.
In 2009 Amnesty International accused Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement of committing war crimes during Israel's January offensive in Gaza, called  Operation Cast Lead, that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The 117-page Amnesty report charged Israeli forces with killing hundreds of civilians and wanton destruction of thousands of homes. Amnesty found no evidence of Palestinian militants using human shields to stop Israeli attacks. A subsequent  United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict was carried out; Amnesty stated that its findings were consistent with those of Amnesty's own field investigation, and called on the UN to act promptly to implement the mission's recommendations.
In February 2010,  Amnesty suspended  Gita Sahgal, its gender unit head, after she criticised Amnesty for its links with  Moazzam Begg, Director of a campaign group called  Cageprisoners. She had called the links &quot;a gross error of judgment&quot; that risked Amnesty's reputation on human rights, and said it was wrong to ally with &quot;Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban&quot;. Amnesty responded that Sahgal was not suspended &quot;for raising these issues internally... [Begg] speaks about his own views ..., not Amnesty International's.&quot; Among those who spoke up for Saghal were  Salman Rushdie (&quot;Amnesty ... has done its reputation incalculable damage.... It looks very much as if Amnesty's leadership is suffering from a kind of moral bankruptcy, and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong&quot;), Member of Parliament  Denis MacShane,  Joan Smith,  Christopher Hitchens,  Martin Bright,  Melanie Phillips, and  Nick Cohen.
In February 2011, Amnesty requested that Swiss authorities start a criminal investigation of former U.S. President George W. Bush and arrest him.
In July 2011, Amnesty International celebrated its 50 years with an animated short film directed by Carlos Lascano, produced by Eallin Motion Art and Dreamlife Studio, with music by Academy Award winner  Hans Zimmer and nominee Lorne Balfe. The film shows that the fight for humanity is not yet over.
A vital part of AI's mandate is the so-called &quot;violence clause&quot;. It sets  prisoners of conscience apart from the other categories of prisoners on whose behalf the movement works. If a prisoner is serving a sentence imposed, after a fair trial, for activities involving violence, AI will not ask the government to release the prisoner.
AI does not judge whether recourse to violence is justified or not. However, AI does not oppose the political use of violence in itself since The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in its preamble, foresees situations in which people could &quot;be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression&quot;.
AI neither supports nor condemns the resort to violence by political opposition groups in itself, just as AI neither supports nor condemns a government policy of using military force in fighting against armed opposition movements. However, AI supports minimum humane standards that should be respected by governments and armed opposition groups alike. When an opposition group tortures or kills its captives, takes hostages, or commits deliberate and arbitrary killings, AI condemns these abuses.
In pursuit of this vision, Amnesty International's mission is to undertake research and action focused on preventing and ending grave abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity, freedom of conscience and expression, and freedom from discrimination, within the context of its work to promote all human rights.
—Statute of Amnesty International, 27th International Council meeting, 2005
Amnesty International primarily targets governments, but also reports on non-governmental bodies and private individuals (&quot; non-state actors&quot;).
There are six key areas which Amnesty deals with:
Some specific aims are to: abolish the death penalty, end  extra judicial executions and  &quot;disappearances,&quot; ensure prison conditions meet international human rights standards, ensure prompt and fair trial for all  political prisoners, ensure free education to all children worldwide, decriminalise abortion, fight  impunity from systems of justice, end the recruitment and use of child soldiers, free all  prisoners of conscience, promote economic, social and cultural rights for marginalised communities, protect  human rights defenders, promote  religious tolerance, protect  LGBT rights, stop  torture and ill-treatment, stop unlawful killings in armed conflict, uphold the rights of  refugees,  migrants, and  asylum seekers, and protect human dignity.
To further these aims, Amnesty International has developed several techniques to publicise information and mobilise public opinion. The organisation considers as one of its strengths the publication of impartial and accurate reports. Reports are researched by: interviewing victims and officials, observing trials, working with local human rights activists, and monitoring the media. It aims to issue timely press releases and publishes information in newsletters and on web sites. It also sends official missions to countries to make courteous but insistent inquiries.
Campaigns to mobilise public opinion can take the form of individual, country, or thematic campaigns. Many techniques are deployed, such as direct appeals (for example, letter writing), media and publicity work, and public demonstrations. Often, fund-raising is integrated with campaigning.
In situations which require immediate attention, Amnesty International calls on existing urgent action networks or crisis response networks; for all other matters, it calls on its membership. It considers the large size of its human resources to be another of its key strengths.
The role of Amnesty International has an immense impact on getting citizens onboard(sic) with focusing on human rights issues. These groups influence countries and governments to give their people justice with pressure and in man power. An example of Amnesty International's work, which began in the 1960s, is writing letters to free imprisoned people that were put there for non-violent expressions. The group now has power, attends sessions, and became a source of information for the U.N. The increase in participation of non-governmental organisations changes how we live today. Felix Dodds states in a recent document that, &quot;In 1972 there were 39 democratic countries in the world; by 2002, there were 139.&quot; This shows that non-governmental organisations make enormous leaps within a short period of time for human rights.
Amnesty reports disproportionately on relatively more democratic and open countries, arguing that its intention is not to produce a range of reports which statistically represents the world's human rights abuses, but rather to apply the pressure of public opinion to encourage improvements. The  demonstration effect of the behaviour of both key Western governments and major non-Western states is an important factor: as one former Amnesty Secretary-General pointed out, &quot;for many countries and a large number of people, the United States is a model,&quot; and according to one Amnesty manager, &quot;large countries inﬂuence small countries.&quot; In addition, with the end of the Cold War, Amnesty felt that a greater emphasis on human rights in the North was needed to improve its credibility with its Southern critics by demonstrating its willingness to report on human rights issues in a truly global manner.
According to one academic study, as a result of these considerations the frequency of Amnesty's reports is influenced by a number of factors, besides the frequency and severity of human rights abuses. For example, Amnesty reports significantly more (than predicted by human rights abuses) on more economically powerful states; and on countries which receive US military aid, on the basis that this Western complicity in abuses increases the likelihood of public pressure being able to make a difference. In addition, around 1993–94, Amnesty consciously developed its media relations, producing fewer background reports and more press releases, to increase the impact of its reports. Press releases are partly driven by news coverage, to use existing news coverage as leverage to discuss Amnesty's human rights concerns. This increases Amnesty's focus on the countries the media is more interested in.
Despite these explanations, Amnesty has been vocal in regards to Israel. Amnesty, for example, helped popularize the concept of &quot;Israeli apartheid&quot; and spread the myth of the &quot;Jenin massacre&quot;. In 2010, the head of Amnesty's Finnish branch, Frank Johansson, called Israel a &quot;scum state,&quot; and in 2011 a top Amnesty UK official, Kristyan Benedict, said Israel, &quot;along with Burma North Korea, Iran and Sudan,&quot; was one of the &quot;stupid dictatorial regimes who abuse peoples’ basic universal rights.&quot;
Amnesty's country focus is similar to that of some other comparable NGOs, notably  Human Rights Watch: between 1991 and 2000, Amnesty and HRW shared eight of ten countries in their &quot;top ten&quot; (by Amnesty press releases; 7 for Amnesty reports). In addition, six of the 10 countries most reported on by Human Rights Watch in the 1990s also made  The Economist's and  Newsweek's &quot;most covered&quot; lists during that time.

         In August 2012 Amnesty International' Chief Executive in India, sought an impartial investigation, led by the United Nations, to render justice to those affected by war crimes in Sri Lanka.
Amnesty International, through its &quot;Artists For Amnesty&quot; program has also endorsed various cultural media works for what its leadership often consider accurate or educational treatments of real-world topics which fall within the range of Amnesty's concern:
Amnesty International is largely made up of voluntary members, but retains a small number of paid professionals. In countries in which Amnesty International has a strong presence, members are organised as 'sections'. Sections coordinate basic Amnesty International activities normally with a significant number of members, some of whom will form into 'groups', and a professional staff. Each have a board of directors. In 2005 there were 52 sections worldwide. 'Structures' are aspiring sections. They also coordinate basic activities but have a smaller membership and a limited staff. In countries where no section or structure exists, people can become 'international members'. Two other organisational models exist: 'international networks', which promote specific themes or have a specific identity, and 'affiliated groups', which do the same work as section groups, but in isolation.
The organisations outlined above are represented by the International Council (IC) which is led by the IC Chairperson. Members of sections and structures have the right to appoint one or more representatives to the Council according to the size of their membership. The IC may invite representatives from International Networks and other individuals to meetings, but only representatives from sections and structures have voting rights. The function of the IC is to appoint and hold accountable internal governing bodies and to determine the direction of the movement. The IC convenes every two years.
The International Executive Committee (IEC), led by the IEC Chairperson, consists of eight members and the IEC Treasurer. It is elected by, and represents, the IC and meets biannually. The role of the IEC is to take decisions on behalf of Amnesty International, implement the strategy laid out by the IC, and ensure compliance with the organisation's statutes.
The International Secretariat (IS) is responsible for the conduct and daily affairs of Amnesty International under direction from the IEC and IC. It is run by approximately 500 professional staff members and is headed by a Secretary General. The IS operates several work programmes; International Law and Organisations; Research; Campaigns; Mobilisation; and Communications. Its offices have been located in London since its establishment in the mid-1960s.
Amnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership. It says that it does not accept donations from governments or governmental organisations. According to the AI website, &quot;these personal and unaffiliated donations allow AI to maintain full independence from any and all governments, political ideologies, economic interests or religions. We neither seek nor accept any funds for human rights research from governments or political parties and we accept support only from businesses that have been carefully vetted. By way of ethical fundraising leading to donations from individuals, we are able to stand firm and unwavering in our defence of universal and indivisible human rights.&quot;
However, AI did receive grants from the UK  Department for International Development, the  European Commission, the  United States State Department. and other governments
In November 2012, the Amnesty staff in London went on strike to protest work conditions and financial issues with the organisation.  Gerald Steinberg, of  NGO Monitor said, &quot;They really are in trouble. They’ve been in crisis for a number of years.&quot;
In the UK Amnesty International has two principal arms, Amnesty International UK and Amnesty International Charity Ltd. Both are UK-based organisations but only the latter is a charity.
Criticism of Amnesty International includes claims of excessive pay for management, underprotection of overseas staff, associating with organisations with a dubious record on human rights protection,  selection bias,  ideological/foreign policy bias against either non- Western countries or  Western-supported countries, criticism of Amnesty's policies relating to abortion, and assertion that &quot;defensive  jihad&quot; is not antithetical to human rights. Governments who have criticised Amnesty include those of Canada, Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Russia and the United States, for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments—and of other governments critical of Amnesty International—have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty. As of February 2011, Amnesty is engaged in a dispute with the British union  Unite over Amnesty allegedly attempting to de-recognize some of its foreign-based workers' rights.
In February 2011, newspaper stories in the UK revealed that  Irene Khan had received a payment of UK £533,103 from Amnesty International following her resignation from the organisation on 31 December 2009, a fact pointed to from Amnesty's records for the 2009–2010 financial year. The sum paid to her was in excess of four times her annual salary of £132,490. The deputy secretary general,  Kate Gilmore – who also resigned in December 2009 – received an ex-gratia payment of £320,000.  Peter Pack, the chairman of Amnesty's international executive committee, initially stated on 19 February 2011, &quot;The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of AI (Amnesty International) Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between AI Ltd and Irene Khan.&quot; and that &quot;It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party.&quot;
The payment and AI's initial response to its leakage to the press led to considerable outcry.  Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for  Shipley, decried the payment, telling the  Daily Express, &quot;I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they were subsidising a fat cat payout. This will disillusion many benefactors.&quot; On 21 February Peter Pack issued a further statement, in which he said that the payment was a &quot;unique situation&quot; that was &quot;in the best interest of Amnesty's work&quot; and that there would be no repetition of it. He stated that &quot;the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again.&quot; Pack also stated that Amnesty was &quot;fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights&quot;. On 25 February, Pack issued a more complete statement intended for internal circulation among Amnesty members and staff. This in turn was been made public by Amnesty International Netherlands and Amnesty International Canada. In summary, it states that Amnesty's International Executive Committee (IEC) in 2008 had decided not to prolong Khan's contract for a third term. In the following months, IEC discovered that due to British employment law, it had to choose between the three options of either offering Khan a third term, discontinuing her post and potentially risking legal consequences, or signing a confidential agreement and issuing a pay compensation.

Animal rights, also known as animal liberation, is the idea that the basic interests of non-human animals — for example, the interest in avoiding suffering — should be afforded the same consideration as the basic interests of human beings. Animal rights advocates argue that animals should no longer be regarded as property, or treated as resources for human purposes, but should instead be regarded as  legal persons and members of the moral community.
The idea of extending personhood to animals has the support of legal scholars such as  Alan Dershowitz and  Laurence Tribe of  Harvard Law School, and  animal law courses are now taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the United States.  Stephen Wise, also of Harvard Law School, argues that the first serious judicial challenges to the &quot;legal thinghood of nonhuman animals&quot; may only be a few years away.
The Seattle-based  Great Ape Project is campaigning for the United Nations to adopt a  Declaration on Great Apes, which would see gorillas,  orangutans, chimpanzees and bonobos included in a &quot;community of equals&quot; with human beings, extending to them the protection of three basic interests: the  right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of  torture. This is seen by an increasing number of animal rights lawyers as a first step toward granting rights to other animals.
Critics of the concept of animal rights argue that animals do not have the capacity to enter into a  social contract or make moral choices, and therefore cannot be regarded as possessors of moral rights. The philosopher  Roger Scruton argues that only human beings have duties and that &quot;[t]he corollary is inescapable: we alone have rights.&quot; Critics holding this position argue that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for food, as entertainment, and in research, though human beings may nevertheless have an obligation to ensure they do not suffer unnecessarily. This position is generally called the  animal welfare position, and it is held by some of the oldest of the animal protection agencies.
The 20th-century debate about animal rights can be traced back to the earliest philosophers. In the 6th century BCE, Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher and mathematician—who has been called the first animal rights philosopher—urged respect for animals because he believed in the  transmigration of souls between human and non-human animals: in killing an animal, we might be killing an ancestor. He advocated vegetarianism, rejecting the use of animals as food or religious sacrifices.
 Peter Singer, in the Oxford Companion to Philosophy, writes that the first chapter of  Genesis describes how God gave human beings  dominion over animals, tempered in the Torah by injunctions to be kind; for example, by being required to rest one's oxen on the  sabbath. The New Testament is, he writes, devoid of such injunctions, with Paul interpreting the sabbath requirement as intended to benefit the human owners, not the animals themselves. Augustine argued that Jesus allowed the  Gadarene swine to drown in order to demonstrate that man has no duty of care toward animals, a position adopted by Thomas Aquinas, who argued that humans should be charitable to animals only to make sure that cruel habits do not carry over into our treatment of human beings, a position later supported also by Locke and Kant.
Aristotle, writing in the 4th century BCE, argued that non-human animals ranked far below humans in the  Great Chain of Being, or scala naturae, because of their alleged irrationality, and that they had no interests of their own. One of his pupils,  Theophrastus, disagreed, arguing against eating meat on the grounds that it robbed animals of life and was therefore unjust. Non-human animals, he said, can reason, sense, and feel just as human beings do. This view did not prevail, and it was Aristotle's position—that human and non-human animals exist in different moral realms because one is rational and the other not—that largely persisted until challenged by philosophers in the 1970s.
In  1545 the German painter  Lucas Cranach the Elder - an adherent of the  Reformation and personal friend of Martin Luther - painted a canvas, now unfortunately lost, depicting  hares catching and roasting human hunters. This painting, described as &quot;powerful&quot; by viewers at the time, was evidently painted in reaction to the numerous hunting scenes which Cranach painted in earlier stages of his career, commissioned by the  Elector of Saxony.
In the 17th century, the French philosopher  René Descartes argued that animals have no souls or minds, and are nothing but complex  automata. They therefore cannot think or even feel pain. They do have sensory equipment so they can see, hear and touch, and may even feel anger and fear, but they are not, in any sense, conscious. Against this, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in the preface of his  Discourse on Inequality (1754), argued that man starts as an animal, though not one &quot;devoid of intellect and freedom.&quot; However, as animals are sensitive beings, &quot;they too ought to participate in  natural right, and … man is subject to some sort of duties toward them,&quot; specifically &quot;one [has] the right not to be uselessly mistreated by the other.&quot;
Contemporaneous with Rousseau was the Scottish writer  John Oswald, who died in 1793. In The Cry of Nature or an Appeal to Mercy and Justice on Behalf of the Persecuted Animals, Oswald argued that man is naturally equipped with feelings of mercy and compassion. If each man had to witness the death of the animals he ate, he argued, a vegetarian diet would be far more common. The division of labor, however, allows modern man to eat flesh without experiencing what Oswald called the prompting of man's natural sensitivities, while the brutalization of modern man made him inured to these sensitivities.
Later in the 18th century, one of the founders of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, argued that animal pain is as real and as morally relevant as human pain, and that &quot;[t]he day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny.&quot; Bentham argued that the ability to suffer, not the ability to  reason, must be the benchmark of how we treat other beings. If the ability to reason were the criterion, many human beings, including babies and disabled people, would also have to be treated as though they were things, famously writing:
It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the  os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of  discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old. But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being? The time will come when humanity will extend its mantle over everything which breathes…
In the 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer argued that non-human animals have the same essence as humans, despite lacking the faculty of reason. Although he considered vegetarianism to be only  supererogatory, he argued for consideration to be given to animals in morality, and he opposed  vivisection. His critique of Kantian ethics contains a lengthy and often furious polemic against the exclusion of animals in his moral system.
The world's first  animal welfare organization, the  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was founded in Britain in 1824, and similar groups soon sprang up elsewhere in Europe and then in North America. The first such group in the United States, the  American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was chartered in the state of  New York in 1866. The first anti-vivisection movement was created in the second half of the 19th century. The concept of animal rights became the subject of an influential book in 1892, Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress, by English social reformer  Henry Salt, who had formed the Humanitarian League a year earlier, with the objective of banning hunting as a sport.
By the late 20th century, animal welfare societies and laws against cruelty to animals existed in almost every country in the world. Specialized animal advocacy groups also proliferated, including those dedicated to the preservation of endangered species, and others, such as  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), that protested against painful or brutal methods of hunting animals, the mistreatment of animals raised for food in  factory farms, and the use of animals in experiments and as entertainment.
The origins of the modern animal rights movement can be traced to Britain in the late 1960s/early 1970s, and in particular to a group of scholars, particularly philosophers, at Oxford University, now known as the Oxford group. It is one of the few examples of a social movement created and to a large extent sustained by philosophers. Psychologist Richard Ryder, who was part of the Oxford Group, writes that &quot;rarely has a cause been so rationally argued and so intellectually well armed.&quot;
Ryder cites a 1965 article by novelist  Brigid Brophy in the Sunday Times as helping to spark the movement. Brophy wrote:
The relationship of homo sapiens to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrail in the hope — or on the mere offchance — that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present.
Ryder wrote letters to the Daily Telegraph in response to Brophy's arguments These were not, he writes, the result of involvement with the animal welfare movement, which he describes as stagnant at the time, but a &quot;spontaneous eruption of thought and indignation&quot; based on the tension between his sympathies for animals and incidents he had witnessed in laboratories in Cambridge, Edinburgh, New York, and California. Brophy read Ryder's letters and put him in touch with Oxford philosophers Stanley and Roslind Godlovitch, and John Harris, who were working on a book about the issue.
A year later, in 1970, Ryder coined the phrase &quot; speciesism,&quot; first using it in a privately printed pamphlet to describe the assignment of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their membership of a particular species. Ryder subsequently became a contributor to the influential Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans(1972), edited by John Harris and the Godlovitches. Rosalind Godlovitch's essay &quot;Animal and Morals&quot; was published in the same year.
It was in a review of Animals, Men and Morals for the  New York Review of Books that  Peter Singer first put forward his basic arguments, based on utilitarianism and drawing an explicit comparison between women's liberation and animal liberation. The review was the basis of Singer's  Animal Liberation, published in 1975, and widely regarded as the bible of the animal rights movement.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the movement was joined by a wide variety of academic and professional groups, including theologians, lawyers, physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, veterinarians, pathologists and former vivisectionists.
Other books regarded as ground-breaking include The Case for Animal Rights by  Tom Regan (1983); Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism by  James Rachels(1990); Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals by  Steven M. Wise (2000); and Animal Rights and Moral Philosophy Julian H. Franklin (2005).
Animal rights is the concept that all or some animals are entitled to possess their own lives; that they are deserving of, or already possess, certain moral rights; and that some basic rights for animals ought to be enshrined in law. The animal-rights view rejects the concept that animals are merely capital goods or property intended for the benefit of humans. The concept is often confused with  animal welfare, which is the philosophy that takes cruelty towards animals and animal suffering into account, but that does not assign specific moral rights to them.
The animal-rights philosophy does not necessarily maintain that human and non-human animals are equal. For example, animal-rights advocates do not call for voting rights for chickens. Some activists also make a distinction between  sentient or self-aware animals and other life forms, with the belief that only sentient animals, or perhaps only animals who have a significant degree of self-awareness, should be afforded the right to possess their own lives and bodies, without regard to how they are valued by humans. Activists maintain that any human being or institution that commodifies animals for food, entertainment, cosmetics, clothing,  animal testing, or for any other reason, infringes upon the animals' right to possess themselves and to pursue their own ends.
In the late 1960s and early '70s,  Martin E. P. Seligman demonstrated that dogs repeatedly exposed to inescapable electroshocks are very similar to severely depressed humans. He wrote:
So there are considerable parallels between the behaviors which define learned helplessness and major  symptoms of depression. Helpless animals become passive in the face of later trauma; they do not initiate responses to control trauma and the amplitude of responding is lowered. Depressed patients are characterized by diminished response initiation; their behavioural repertoire is impoverished and in severe cases, almost stuporous. Helpless animals do not benefit from exposure to experiences in which responding now produces relief; rather they often revert to passively accepting shock. Depressed patients have strong negative expectations about the effectiveness of their own responding. They construe even actions that succeed as having failed and underestimate and devalue their own performance. In addition, evidence exists which suggests that both learned helplessness and  depression dissipate in time, are associated with weight loss and  anorexia, or loss of  libido, and  norepinephrine depletion. Finally, it is not an accident that we have used the word “helplessness” to describe the behaviour of dogs in our laboratory. Animals that lie down in traumatic shock that could be removed simply by jumping to the other side, and who fail even to make escape movements are readily seen as helpless. Moreover we should not forget that depressed patients commonly describe themselves helpless, hopeless, and powerless.
In contrast, animals like  jellyfish have simple nervous systems, and may be little more than automata, capable of basic reflexes but incapable of formulating any ends to their actions or plans to pursue them, and equally unable to notice whether they are in captivity. But the biology of mind is largely a  black box and claims regarding the existence or absence of mind in other animals, based on their physiology, are speculative. American writer  Sam Harris, currently writing a doctoral thesis on the neuroscience of mind, argues:
Inevitably, scientists treat consciousness as a mere attribute of certain large-brained animals. The problem, however, is that nothing about a brain, when surveyed as a physical system, delares it to be a bearer of that peculiar, inner dimension that each of us experiences as consciousness in his own case … The operational definition of consciousness … is reportability. But consciousness and reportabiltiy are not the same thing. Is a starfish conscious? No science that conflates consciousness with reportabilty will deliver an answer to this question. To look for consciousness in the world on the basis of its outward signs is the only thing we can do. And so, while we know many things about ourselves [and other animals] in anatomical, physiological, and evolutionary terms, we currently have no idea why it is &quot;like something&quot; to be what we are. The fact that the universe is illuminated where you stand, the fact that your thoughts and moods and sensations have a qualitative character, is an absolute mystery.
— Ingrid Newkirk, President of  PETA, 
Mameli and Bortolotti argue that animal rights are questionable because humans cannot understand the subjective state of animals.
Opponents of animal rights have attempted to identify morally relevant differences between humans and animals that might justify the attribution of rights and interests to the former but not to the latter. Various distinguishing features of humans have been proposed, including the possession of a  soul, the ability to use language,  self-consciousness, a high level of intelligence, and the ability to recognize the rights and interests of others.
Peter Singer and Tom Regan are the best-known proponents of animal liberation, though they differ in their philosophical approaches. Another influential thinker is  Gary L. Francione, who presents an  abolitionist view that non-human animals should have the basic right not to be treated as the property of humans.
Although Singer is said to be the ideological founder of today's animal-liberation movement, his approach to an animal's moral status is not based on the concept of rights, but on the utilitarian principle of  equal consideration of interests. His 1975 book  Animal Liberation argues that humans grant moral consideration to other humans not on the basis of intelligence (in the instance of children, or the mentally disabled), on the ability to moralize (criminals and the insane), or on any other attribute that is inherently human, but rather on their ability to experience suffering. As animals also experience suffering, he argues, excluding animals from such consideration is a form of discrimination known as &quot; speciesism.&quot;
Singer uses a particularly compelling argument called the  Argument from Marginal Cases. If we give rights to humans based on some quality they possess, then we cannot argue that humans that lack that quality should have rights. Such a quality may be sentience or ability to enter a social contract or rationality. But an infant born with a defect so that it will never have those qualities can not be granted rights without invoking  speciesism. Singer argues that the way in which humans use animals is not justified, because the benefits to humans are negligible compared to the amount of animal suffering they necessarily entail, and because he feels the same benefits can be obtained in ways that do not involve the same degree of suffering.
A debate between Singer and Judge  Richard Posner is listed online. In it, Posner first argues that instead of starting his philosophy with the idea that consideration of pain for all animals is equal, his moral intuition tells him that humans prefer their own. If a dog threatened a human infant, and it required causing more pain to the dog to get it to stop than the dog would have caused to the infant, then we, as humans, favour the child. It would be &quot;monstrous to spare the dog,&quot; Posner argues. Singer challenges Posner's moral intuition by arguing that formerly unequal rights for homosexuals, women, and those of different races also were justified using the same set of intuitions. Posner replies that equality in civil rights did not occur because of ethical arguments, but because facts mounted that there were not significant differences between humans based on race, sex, or sexual orientation that would support that inequality. If and when similar facts mount on the differences between humans and animals, those differences in rights will erode. But facts will drive equality, and not ethical arguments that run contrary to moral instinct. Posner calls his approach soft utilitarian in contrast to Singer's hard utilitarian. Posner argues:
The &quot;soft&quot; utilitarian position on animal rights is a moral intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, and we think that to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.
Tom Regan (The Case for Animal Rights and  Empty Cages) argues that non-human animals, as &quot;subjects-of-a-life,&quot; are bearers of rights like humans. He argues that, because the moral rights of humans are based on their possession of certain  cognitive abilities, and because these abilities are also possessed by at least some non-human animals, such animals must have the same moral rights as humans. Although only humans act as moral agents, both marginal case humans and at least some non-humans must have the status of moral patients.
Animals in this class have &quot;inherent value&quot; as individuals, and cannot be regarded as means to an end. This is also called the &quot;direct duty&quot; view. According to Regan, we should abolish the breeding of animals for food, animal experimentation, and commercial hunting. Regan's theory does not extend to all sentient animals but only to those that can be regarded as &quot;subjects-of-a-life.&quot; He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify in this regard.
The predation reduction argument is often applied to Regan's rights-based approach. If we are to protect animals with rights from moral patient humans, must we also protect them from other animals? This raises the issue of whether giving animals 'moral patient' status condemns to extermination certain classes of predation.
While Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, at least in some hypothetical scenarios, animals could be legitimately used for further (human or non-human) ends, Regan believes we ought to treat animals as we would persons, and he applies the strict Kantian idea that they ought never to be sacrificed as mere means to ends, and must be treated as ends unto themselves. Notably, Kant himself did not believe animals were subject to what he called the moral law; like Aquinas and Locke, Kant recommended kindness towards animals not for the sake of animals themselves, but mainly because he thought that those who are cruel towards animals are likely to tend to be cruel towards human beings too.
Despite these theoretical differences, both Singer and Regan largely agree about what to do in practise. For example, they agree that the adoption of a  vegan diet and the abolition of nearly all forms of  animal testing are ethically mandatory.
Critics such as  Carl Cohen, professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan Medical School, oppose the granting of personhood to animals. Cohen wrote in the  New England Journal of Medicine in October 1986: that &quot;[t]he holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, the holders of rights must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked.&quot;
Cohen rejects  Peter Singer's argument that since a brain-damaged human could not exhibit the ability to make moral judgments, that moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen states that the test for moral judgment &quot;is not a test to be administered to humans one by one.&quot; This is also known as the Argument from Species Normality. 
The British philosopher  Roger Scruton has argued that rights can only be assigned to beings who are able to understand them and to reciprocate by observing their own obligations to other beings. In The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice, the British philosopher Peter Carruthers argues that humans have obligations only to other beings who can take part in a hypothetical  social contract. thus animals are excluded from the group of beings to whom humans have moral obligations. Social contract arguments do not address the problem of animals acting as if they have entered into such contracts with others of their species. Cooperation and relatively peaceful coexistence in group situations are characteristics of many species. Jules Masserman (1905–1989), past president of the American Psychiatric Association, concluded in 1964 that: &quot;A majority of rhesus monkeys will consistently suffer hunger rather than secure food at the expense of electroshock to a conspecific.&quot;
 Gary Francione's work (Introduction to Animal Rights, et al.) is based on the premise that if non-human animals are considered to be property then any rights that they may be granted would be directly undermined by that property status. He points out that a call to equally consider the interests of your property against your own interests is absurd. Without the basic right not to be treated as the property of humans, non-human animals have no rights whatsoever, he says. Francione posits that sentience is the only valid determinant for moral standing, unlike Regan who sees qualitative degrees in the subjective experiences of his &quot;subjects-of-a-life&quot; based upon a loose determination of who falls within that category. Francione claims that there is no actual animal-rights movement in the United States, but only an  animal-welfarist movement. In line with his philosophical position and his work in animal-rights law for the Animal Rights Law Project at  Rutgers University, he points out that any effort that does not advocate the abolition of the property status of animals is misguided, in that it inevitably results in the institutionalization of animal exploitation. It is logically inconsistent and doomed never to achieve its stated goal of improving the condition of animals, he argues. Francione holds that a society which regards dogs and cats as family members yet kills cows, chickens, and pigs for food exhibits what he calls &quot;moral schizophrenia.&quot;
The Encyclopaedia Britannica cites the Roman jurist  Hermogenianus writing in the 3rd or 4th century  CE that: &quot;Hominum causa omne jus constitum&quot;—&quot;All law was established for men's sake&quot;—a position repeated in P.A. Fitzgerald's Salmond on Jurisprudence (1966), in which he wrote: &quot;The law is made for men and allows no fellowship or bonds of obligation between them and the lower animals.&quot;
This view categorizes animals as property; not as legal persons with rights, but as things that other legal persons exercise their rights in relation to. Current animal law therefore addresses the rights of the people who own animals, not the rights of the animals themselves. There are  criminal laws against cruelty to animals; laws that regulate the keeping of animals in cities and on farms; laws regulating the transit of animals internationally, and governing quarantine and inspection provisions. These are designed to offer animals some protection from unnecessary physical harm and to regulate the use of animals as food, but they offer no civil rights to animals, who have a status similar to that of human slaves before abolition. American legal scholar  Steven Wise writes in the Encyclopaedia Britannica that the failure to recognize individual rights makes animals &quot;invisible to civil law.&quot;
There is increasing interest in the concept of animal rights in law. The idea of extending personhood to animals is gaining the support of mainstream legal scholars such as  Alan Dershowitz and  Laurence Tribe. Animal law courses are taught in 91 out of 180 U.S. law schools, and 47 U.S. law schools have student  animal legal defense funds, with more being set up in Australia and Europe. Three specialist legal journals have been established—Animal Law, the Journal of Animal Law, and the Journal of Animal Law and Ethics.
In 2006, Brazilians founded the  Brazilian Animal Rights Review, the first legal journal about animal law in a  developing country. Brazil has advanced legislation: since 1988, their Constitution recognizes the protection of animals against cruelty.
Switzerland passed legislation in 1992 to recognize animals as beings, rather than things, and the protection of animals was enshrined in the German constitution in 2002, when its upper house of parliament voted to add the words &quot;and animals&quot; to the clause in the constitution obliging the state to protect the &quot;natural foundations of life … in the interests of future generations.&quot;
Steven Wise writes that the legal arguments in favour of animal rights are &quot;powerfully assisted by increasingly sophisticated scientific investigations into the cognitive, emotional, and social capacities of animals and by advances in genetics, neuroscience, physiology, linguistics, psychology, evolution, and ethology, many of which have demonstrated that humans and animals share a broad range of behaviours, capacities, and genetic material.&quot; Wise argues that the first serious judicial challenges to the &quot;legal thinghood of nonhuman animals&quot; may only be a few years away.
 Political parties advocating animal welfare and animal rights have been founded since 2005 in Spain, the UK, Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands the  Party for the Animals (Partij voor de Dieren) is the worlds first political party with an agenda focused primarily on animal welfare and animal rights. The party holds two seats in Dutch Parliament since the last national elections in November 2006.
Some writers and animal rights groups have drawn a comparison between the treatment of animals and the Holocaust. Jewish Nobel Prize winner  Isaac Bashevis Singer, wrote in Enemies, a Love Story:
As often as Herman had witnessed the slaughter of animals and fish, he always had the same thought: In their behaviour toward creatures, all men were Nazis. The smugness with which man could do with other species as he pleased exemplified the most extreme racist theories, the principle that might is right.
Charles Patterson in Eternal Treblinka argues that &quot;Nazi genocide and modern society's enslavement and slaughter of non-human animals&quot; share common roots.  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organized a touring exhibition in 2003 entitled &quot; Holocaust on your Plate,&quot; which mixed imagery of Jews in concentration camps with animals being killed and abused. The  National Primate Research Exhibition Hall, a project of animal rights activists in  Wisconsin, compares itself to the Holocaust Memorial at  Auschwitz and plans extensive use of such imagery in its exhibits.
The comparison has been criticized by the  Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  Roberta Kalechofsky of  Jews for Animal Rights argues that, although there is &quot;connective tissue&quot; between animal suffering and the Holocaust, they &quot;fall into different historical frameworks, and comparison between them aborts the ... force of  anti-Semitism.

Adelaide (pron.:  / ˈ æ d ə l eɪ d /) is the  capital city of  South Australia and the fifth-largest city in Australia. According to the 2011 census, Adelaide has a population of 1.23 million. The demonym &quot;Adelaidean&quot; is used in reference to the city and its residents. Adelaide is north of the  Fleurieu Peninsula, on the  Adelaide Plains between the  Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges which surround the city. Adelaide stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills, and 90 km (56 mi) from  Gawler at its northern extent to  Sellicks Beach in the south.
Named in honour of  Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen,  queen consort to King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the  planned capital for a freely settled British province in Australia.  Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the  River Torrens in the area originally inhabited by the  Kaurna people. Light's design set out Adelaide in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by  parkland. Early Adelaide was shaped by religious freedom and a commitment to political  progressivism and civil liberties, which led to the moniker &quot;City of Churches&quot;.
As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the  city centre along the cultural boulevard of  North Terrace,  King William Street and in various districts of the metropolitan area. Today, Adelaide is noted for  its many festivals and sporting events, its food, wine and culture, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. It ranks highly in terms of liveability, being listed in the Top 10 of  The Economist's World's Most Liveable Cities index in 2010 and being ranked the most liveable city in Australia by the Property Council of Australia in 2011 and again in 2012.
Prior to its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous  Kaurna  Aboriginal nation (pronounced &quot;Garner&quot; or &quot;Gowna&quot;).
South Australia was officially proclaimed as a new British colony on 28 December 1836, near  The Old Gum Tree in what is now the suburb of  Glenelg North. The event is commemorated in South Australia as  Proclamation Day. The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, through the design made by the architect  George Strickland Kingston. In 1823, Light had fondly written of the Sicilian city of  Catania: &quot;The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile long&quot;, and this became the basis for the plan of Adelaide. Light chose, not without opposition, a site on rising ground close to the River Torrens, which was the chief early water supply for the fledgling colony. &quot; Light's Vision&quot;, as it has been termed, has meant that the initial design of Adelaide required little modification as the settlement grew and prospered.
Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of  Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals. Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen. Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land. As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share  the convict settlement history of other Australian cities like Sydney, New South Wales; Brisbane, Queensland and  Hobart, Tasmania.
As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the  South Australian Register was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales, and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named  South Australia Police) in April 1838 under 21-year-old  Henry Inman. The first Sheriff, Mr Samuel Smart, was wounded during a robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders, Michael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia. William Baker Ashton was appointed Governor of the temporary goal in 1839, and in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new Gaol. Construction of  Adelaide Gaol commenced in 1841.
Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership. The first governor of South Australia,  John Hindmarsh, clashed frequently with others, in particular with the Resident Commissioner,  James Hurtle Fisher. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over 405 km2 (156 sq mi) of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from  New South Wales and  Tasmania. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period, and land was promptly offered for sale to early colonists. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from  Encounter Bay in the south to  Clare in the north.
 Governor Gawler took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the Select Committee on South Australia in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the  Adelaide Gaol, police barracks, a hospital, a customs house and a wharf at  Port Adelaide. In addition, houses for public officials and missionaries, and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship. Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficient during this period, but at heavy cost: as a result of Gawler's public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. Gawler was recalled and replaced by  Governor Grey in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in  Glen Osmond that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.
Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the Murray River being successfully navigated in 1853 by  Francis Cadell, an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a  self-governing colony in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament.  Secret ballots were introduced, and a  bicameral parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.
In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. In 1867 gas street lighting was implemented, the  University of Adelaide was founded in 1874, the  South Australian Art Gallery opened in 1881 and the  Happy Valley Reservoir opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at  Broken Hill provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.
Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom but, with the return of droughts, entered the Great Depression of the 1930s, later returning to prosperity under strong government leadership.  Secondary industries helped reduce the state's dependence on  primary industries. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the  Playford Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Seventy thousand men and women enlisted and shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of  Whyalla.
The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors  Holden and  Chrysler made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. A pipeline from  Mannum brought River Murray water to Adelaide in 1954 and  an airport opened at  West Beach in 1955. An assisted migration scheme brought 215,000 immigrants of many nationalities, mainly European, to South Australia between 1947 and 1973.  Flinders University and the  Flinders Medical Centre were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, South of the City.
The  Dunstan Governments of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival' – establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts, building upon the biennial &quot; Adelaide Festival of Arts&quot; which commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the Formula One  Australian Grand Prix between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands, before tough economic conditions due to the state bank collapse. The 1991  State Bank collapse plunged both Adelaide and South Australia into economic recession, and its effects lasted until 2004, when ratings agency  Standard &amp; Poor's reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating. Recent years have seen the  Clipsal 500  V8 Supercars race make use of sections of the former Formula One circuit. Adelaide's tallest building, built in 1988, was formerly known as the State Bank until the recession in 1991 and renamed the Santos Building up until 2006.
Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills, and 90 km (56 mi) from  Gawler at its northern extent to  Sellicks Beach in the south. According to the  Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Adelaide Metropolitan Region has a total land area of 870 km2 (340 sq mi), and is at an average elevation of 50 metres (160 ft) above sea level.  Mount Lofty is east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of 727 metres (2,385 ft). It is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of  Burra.
Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive affect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaides beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the  Cleland Conservation Park and  Belair National Park. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and  Onkaparinga catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the  Happy Valley Reservoir supplying around 40% and the much larger  Mount Bold Reservoir 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.
Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel  William Light. His plan, now known as Light's Vision, arranged Adelaide in a grid, with  five squares in the  Adelaide city centre and a ring of parks, known as the  Adelaide Parklands, surrounding it. Light's design was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first Governor, John Hindmarsh. Light persisted with his design against this initial opposition.
The benefits of Light's design are numerous; Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable grid layout and a beautiful green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of  ring roads in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The  inner ring route ( A21) borders the parklands, and the outer route ( A3/ A13/ A16/ A17) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order)  Grand Junction Road, Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue,  Portrush Road,  Cross Road and  South Road.
Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and &quot;country towns&quot;, and the satellite city of  Elizabeth, have been enveloped by its  suburban sprawl. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the  South Eastern Freeway to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's  South led to the construction of the  Southern Expressway.
New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The  O-Bahn Busway is an example of a unique solution to  Tea Tree Gully's transport woes in the 1980s. The development of the nearby suburb of  Golden Grove in the late 1980s is possibly an example of well-thought-out urban planning. The newer suburban areas as a whole, however, are not as integrated into the urban layout as much as older areas, and therefore place more stress on Adelaide's transportation system – although not on a level comparable with Melbourne or Sydney.
In the 1960s, a  Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways,  expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier  Steele Hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later  Labor government elected under  Don Dunstan shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the  Liberal party won government and premier  David Tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.
In 2008, the  SA Government announced plans for a network of  transport-oriented developments across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a  10 hectare industrial site at  Bowden for $52.5 million as the first of these developments.
Adelaide has a warm  Mediterranean climate ( Köppen climate classification Csa), where most of the rain falls in the winter months. Despite a warm Mediterranean climate, Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid Köppen's BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80 mm. Frosts are occasional, with the most notable occurrences having occurred in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is uncommon, except for very light falls at Mount Lofty and some places in the Adelaide Hills, with the most recent occurrence being in October 2012.

        
Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the  Government of South Australia. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the  City of Adelaide. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the state government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The state parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.
The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between eighteen  local government areas, including, at its centre, the  City of Adelaide, which administers the  Adelaide city centre,  North Adelaide, and the surrounding  Adelaide Parklands. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor,  James Hurtle Fisher, was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a  Lord Mayor, the current being Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood.
As of 2006 Census, Adelaide had a metropolitan population of more than 1,105,839, making it Australia's fifth largest city. In the 2002–03 period the population grew by 0.6%, while the national average was 1.2%. Some 70.3% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.
Major areas of population growth in recent years were in outer suburbs such as  Mawson Lakes and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 341,227 houses, 54,826 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,327 flats, units or apartments.
High socioeconomic areas include a number of the coastal suburbs, most of the inner north-eastern, eastern, south-eastern and inner southern suburbs, the Adelaide hills and  North Adelaide. Almost a fifth (17.9%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.
Overseas-born Adelaideans composed 23.7% (262,367) of the total population. The north-western suburbs (such as  Woodville and  Athol Park) and suburbs close to the CBD have a higher ratio of overseas-born residents. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (7.3%), Italy (1.9%), Scotland (1.0%), Vietnam (0.9%), and Greece (0.9%). The most-spoken languages other than  English were Italian (3.0%), Greek (2.2%),  Vietnamese (1.2%),  Mandarin (0.8%), and  Cantonese (0.7%).
The large number of churches in the city of Adelaide has led to it being known as The City of Churches. However, approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of the least religious cities in Australia. Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being  Catholic (21.3%),  Anglican (12.6%),  Uniting Church (7.6%) and Eastern Orthodox (3.5%).
Overall, Adelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. Just over a quarter (26.7%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55 years or older, in comparison to the national average of 24.3%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), which composed 17.8% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.8%.
South Australia's largest employment sector is health care and social assistance, surpassing manufacturing in SA as the largest employer since 2006–07. In 2009–10, manufacturing in SA had average annual employment of 83,700 persons compared with 103,300 for health care and social assistance. Health care and social assistance represented nearly 13% of the state average annual employment.
The retail trade is the second largest employer in SA (2009–10), with 91,900 jobs, and 12 per cent of the state workforce.
Manufacturing, defence technology, high tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide at the  General Motors Holden plant in  Elizabeth. Adelaide has over 40% of Australia's high-tech electronics industry which designs and produces electronic systems that are sold worldwide for applications in medical, communications, defence, automotive, food and wine processing and industrial sectors. The revenue of Adelaide's electronics industry has grown at over 15% per annum since 1990, and in 2010 exceeds A$5 billion. The electronics industry in Adelaide employs over 14,000 people or 17% of all manufacturing employment. The South Australian economy, very closely tied to Adelaide's, still enjoys a trade surplus and has higher per capita growth than Australia as a whole.
The  collapse of the State Bank in 1992 resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4 billion). The collapse had meant that successive governments had enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which had been a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.
The global media conglomerate  News Corporation was founded in and until 2004 incorporated in Adelaide and is still considered its 'spiritual' home by Rupert Murdoch. Australia's largest oil company,  Santos, prominent South Australian brewery,  Coopers, major national retailer  Harris Scarfe and Australia's second largest listed investment company  Argo Investments Limited call Adelaide their home.
Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1 billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. Seventy-two percent of Australian defence companies are in Adelaide. The principal government military research institution, the  Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and other defence technology organisations such as  BAE Systems Australia and Lockheed Martin Australia, are north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called &quot;Edinburgh Parks&quot;, adjacent to  RAAF Base Edinburgh.
Others, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are in or near  Technology Park. The  Australian Submarine Corporation, based in the industrial suburb of  Osborne, was charged with constructing Australia's  Collins class submarines and more recently the A$6 billion contract to construct the  Royal Australian Navy's new  air-warfare destroyers.
There are 466,829 employed people in Adelaide, with 62.3% full-time and 35.1% part-time. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards part-time (which includes casual) employment, increasing from 11.6% of the workplace in 1991, to over a third today.
The median weekly individual income for people aged 15 years and over is $447 per week, compared with $466 nationally. The median family income is $1,137 per week, compared with $1,171 nationally. Adelaide's housing and living costs are substantially lower than that of other Australian cities, with housing being notably cheaper. The median Adelaide house price is half that of Sydney and two-thirds that of Melbourne. The three-month trend unemployment rate to March 2007 was 6.2%. The Northern suburbs' unemployment rate is disproportionately higher than the other regions of Adelaide at 8.3%, while the East and South are lower than the Adelaide average at 4.9% and 5.0% respectively.
Over the decade March 2001 – March 2010, Metropolitan Adelaide median house prices approximately tripled. (approx. 285% – approx. 11%p.a. compounding) In the 5 years March 2007 – March 2012, prices increased by approx. 27% – approx. 5%p.a. compounding.   
In summary:
All numbers approximate and rounded
Each quarter, The Real Estate Institute of South Australia (REISA) publishes a list of median house sale prices by suburb. Due to the small size of many of Adelaide's suburbs, the low volumes of sales in these suburbs, and (over time) the huge variations in the numbers of sales in a suburb in a quarter, statistical analysis of &quot;the most expensive suburb&quot; is unreliable; the suburbs appearing in the &quot;top 10 most expensive suburbs this quarter&quot; list is constantly varying. Quarterly Reports for the last two years can be found on the REISA website.
Education forms an increasingly important part of the city's economy, with the South Australian Government and educational institutions attempting to position Adelaide as &quot;Australia's education hub&quot; and marketing it as a &quot;Learning City.&quot; The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 23,300, of which 2,380 are secondary school students. In addition to the city's existing institutions, foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses in order to increase its attractiveness as an education hub.
At the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and  Catholic schools. All schools provide education under the  South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the  International Baccalaureate (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.
There are three public universities local to Adelaide, as well as three constituent colleges of three foreign universities. The  Flinders University of South Australia, the  University of Adelaide and the  University of South Australia are based in Adelaide and were all ranked within the world's top 400 universities in the  Times Higher Education magazine in 2007. The historic Torrens Building in  Victoria Square houses  Carnegie Mellon University's  Heinz College Australia,  Cranfield University's  Defence College of Management and Technology, and  University College London's School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and constitute the city's international university precinct.
The  University of Adelaide, with 20,478 students, is Australia's third-oldest university, and a member of the leading &quot; Group of Eight&quot;. It has five campuses throughout the state, including two in the city-centre, and also has a campus in Singapore. The  University of South Australia, with 36,000 students, has two North Terrace campuses, three other campuses in the metropolitan area and campuses at  Whyalla and  Mount Gambier. The  Flinders University of South Australia, with 16,237 students, is in the southern suburb of  Bedford Park, alongside the  Flinders Medical Centre, and also maintains a small city campus in Victoria Square.
There are also several South Australian  TAFE (Technical and Further Education) campuses in the metropolitan area which provide a range of vocational education and training. The Adelaide College of the Arts, as a school of TAFE SA, provides nationally recognised training in both visual and performing arts.
In addition to the universities, Adelaide is home to a number of research institutes, including the  Royal Institution of Australia, established in 2009 as a counterpart to the two hundred year-old  Royal Institution of Great Britain. Many of the organisations involved in research tend to be geographically clustered throughout the Adelaide metropolitan area:
While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the vine cuttings that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the  Barossa Valley.
After the Second World War, British, Italian,  Greek,  Dutch,  Polish and other European immigrants settled in Adelaide. The conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975 saw an influx of Indo-Chinese immigrants to Adelaide. See:  Immigration history of Australia
Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers of both major political parties. The renowned  Adelaide Festival of Arts and  Fringe Festival were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the  Adelaide Festival Centre began under Steele Hall in 1970, and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the  South Australian Film Corporation and, in 1976, the  State Opera of South Australia.
Over time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the  Adelaide Cabaret Festival,  Adelaide Film Festival,  Adelaide Festival of Ideas,  Adelaide Writers' Week, and  WOMADelaide, all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (that month is sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include  FEAST (a  queer culture celebration),  Tasting Australia (a biennial food and wine affair), and the  Royal Adelaide Show (an annual  agricultural show and  state fair). There are also many international cultural fairs, most notably the German  Schützenfest and Greek  Glendi. Adelaide is also home to the  Adelaide Christmas Pageant, the world's largest  Christmas parade. As the state capital, Adelaide is also home to a great number of cultural institutions with many along the boulevard of  North Terrace. The  Art Gallery of South Australia, with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection.
Situated adjacent are the  South Australian Museum and  State Library of South Australia, while the  Adelaide Botanic Garden,  National Wine Centre and  Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute are nearby in the  East End of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the  Migration Museum is Australia's oldest museum of its kind. Contemporary art scenes include the  Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia.  Adelaide Festival Centre, on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the  State Theatre Company of South Australia, with other venues including the  Adelaide Entertainment Centre and the city's many smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars.
The  music of Adelaide has produced various musical groups and individuals who have achieved both national and international fame. This includes the  Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, the  Adelaide Youth Orchestra, rock bands:  The Angels,  Cold Chisel,  The Superjesus,  Wolf &amp; Cub,  Fire! Santa Rosa, Fire!, roots/blues group  The Audreys, internationally acclaimed metal acts  I Killed The Prom Queen and  Double Dragon, popular Australian hip-hop outfit  Hilltop Hoods, pop acts like  Sia,  Orianthi,  Guy Sebastian, and  Wes Carr, as well as internationally successful tribute act The  Australian Pink Floyd Show.
Noted rocker  Jimmy Barnes spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of  Elizabeth. Paul Kelly grew up in Adelaide and was head prefect at Rostrevor College. The first  Australian Idol winner,  Guy Sebastian, hails from the north-eastern suburb of  Golden Grove. American musician  Ben Folds used to base himself in Adelaide when he was married to Australian Frally Hynes. Folds recorded a song about Adelaide before he moved away from the city. In addition to its own WOMADelaide, Adelaide attracts several touring music festivals, including  Big Day Out,  Creamfields,  Future Music,  Laneway,  Parklife,  Stereosonic and  Summadayze
Adelaide also plays host to two of Australia's leading contemporary dance companies. The  Australian Dance Theatre and  Leigh Warren &amp; Dancers contribute to state festivals and perform nationally and internationally.  Restless Dance Theatre is also based in Adelaide and is nationally recognised for working with disabled and non-disabled dancers to use movement as a means of expression.
Adelaide pop-concert venues (past and present) include:  Adelaide Entertainment Centre;  Adelaide Festival Theatre;  Adelaide Oval;  Apollo Stadium;  Memorial Drive Park;  Thebarton Theatre. Other concert and live theatre venues include:  Adelaide Town Hall;  Dunstan Playhouse; Her Majesty's Theatre.
The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are Australian rules football, soccer, cricket, netball and basketball. Adelaide is the home of two  Australian Football League teams: the  Adelaide Crows and  Port Adelaide Power, and one  A-League soccer team,  Adelaide United. A local Australian rules football league, the  SANFL, is made up of nine teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1907. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.
Adelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events. Most large sporting events take place at either  AAMI Stadium (the home base of the Adelaide Crows and also the Powers home game venue) or the historic  Adelaide Oval, home of the  Southern Redbacks cricket team. As it has since 1884, Adelaide Oval hosts an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of  One Day International cricket matches.  Memorial Drive Park, adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host the  Adelaide International, a major men's tennis tournament in the lead-up to the Australian Open before the tournament was moved to Brisbane in 2009. Adelaide's professional football team,  Adelaide United, play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is  Hindmarsh Stadium, which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few purpose-built soccer stadia in Australia.
For two years (1997 and 1998), Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level rugby league, this came after the  New South Wales Rugby League had been playing a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval starting in 1991. The  Adelaide Rams were formed and played in the breakaway  Super League (SL) competition in  1997 before moving to the new  National Rugby League in  1998. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a deal with the NRL, the clubs owners  News Limited (who were also owners of the SL) closed the club only weeks before the start of the  1999 season. In 2008 the  Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, a Sydney NRL club, and the South Australian Government announced a three-year contract in which the Sharks will play a single home game each season at Hindmarsh. Unfortunately this only happened for 2009. From 2010 the  Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs signed an agreement to play one home game per season at the Adelaide Oval for three years with the hope of establishing a strong supporter base in Adelaide.
Adelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the  Adelaide 36ers who play in the  NBL and the women's team, the  Adelaide Lightning who play in the  WNBL. The 36ers play their home games at the  Adelaide Arena while the Lightning also play at the Adelaide Arena. Adelaide has a professional netball team, the  Adelaide Thunderbirds, who play in the trans-Tasman netball competition, the  ANZ Championship, with home games played at  ETSA Park. The Thunderbirds also occasionally play games or finals at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, while international netball matches are usually played at either the Entertainment Centre or the Adelaide Arena.
Since 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas has hosted the  Tour Down Under bicycle race, organised and directed by Adelaide based  Mike Turtur (Turtur won an Olympic  gold medal for Australia in the  4000m Team pursuit at the  1984 Los Angeles Olympics). The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and the was the first event outside Europe to be granted  UCI ProTour status.
Adelaide maintains a franchise in the  Australian Baseball League, the  Adelaide Bite. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium is  Coopers Stadium. Their name stems from the local  Great Australian Bight, and from the abundance of local Great White Sharks.
The  Australian Grand Prix for Formula One racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the  Adelaide Street Circuit which was laid out in the city's eastern parklands. The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful  Clipsal 500 for  V8 Supercar racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a  rally of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.
The  World Solar Challenge race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide will host the  2012 World Bowls Championships at Lockleys Bowling Club. Adelaide will become the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.
Adelaide's first hospital is the  Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH). Founded in 1840, it is one of the major hospitals in Adelaide and is a  teaching hospital of the University of Adelaide. It has a capacity of 705 beds. Two other RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are in the suburbs of Adelaide – the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in  Northfield, and the  Glenside Campus Mental Health Service. Four other large hospitals in the Adelaide area are the  Women's and Children's Hospital (305 beds), which is on King William Road in North Adelaide; the  Queen Elizabeth Hospital (340 beds) in Woodville, the  Flinders Medical Centre (580 beds), in Bedford Park and in the northern suburbs, and the  Lyell McEwin Hospital (198 beds) in Elizabeth. These hospitals are also associated with medical schools. The Women's and Children's, the Queen Elizabeth and the Lyell McEwin are affiliated with the  University of Adelaide, Flinders Medical Centre is affiliated  Flinders University, and the Lyell McEwin is also affiliated with the  University of South Australia.
In June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital at the east end of the city. Should it go ahead, the new 800-bed hospital would cost A$1.7 bn and be named the &quot;Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital&quot; after the  former Governor of South Australia. However, in 2009, at the former governor's request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility.
In addition, major upgrades would see the Flinders Medical Centre become the primary centre for health care for the southern suburbs, while upgrades for the  Lyell McEwin Hospital in Elizabeth would see that become the centre for the northern suburbs. The trio of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the  Modbury Hospital and the Noarlunga Hospital would become specialist elective surgery centres. The Repatriation General Hospital would also expand its range of speciality areas beyond veterans' health to incorporate stroke, orthopaedic rehabilitation and aged care. With the &quot;Global Financial Crisis&quot; of 2008, it remains to be seen if and how these initiatives will proceed.
Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide public transport system, which is managed by and known as the  Adelaide Metro. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the  O-Bahn Busway,  metropolitan railways, and the Adelaide- Glenelg Tram, which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of  Hindmarsh.
Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a &quot;twenty-minute city&quot;, with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.
The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:
There are also plans for major upgrades to busy sections of  South Road, including road widening, underpasses and overpasses. The underpass of  Anzac Highway was completed in 2009. Further planned underpasses during the first stage of the project include Grange Road, Port Road, the Glenelg Tramline and the Outer Harbour railway line. An overpass between Regency Road and the Port River Expressway commenced construction in 2012.
The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial Airports,  Adelaide and  Parafield.
 Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's western suburbs, is designed to serve in excess of 6.3 million passengers annually. The dual international/domestic terminal named T1 incorporates glass aerobridges and has the ability to cater for the Airbus A380. The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour. Unusually for a major city, it is only 7 kilometres (4.4 mi) from the  Adelaide city centre. The airport is serviced by five international airlines in addition to domestic, regional and charter operators, including  Air New Zealand,  Cathay Pacific,  Emirates,  Jetstar Airways,  Malaysia Airlines,  Qantas,  QantasLink,  Singapore Airlines and  Virgin Australia. Adelaide airport currently has direct international flights servicing Auckland, Denpasar, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Singapore. In March 2007, Adelaide Airport was rated the world's second best airport in the 5–15 million passengers category at the  Airports Council International (ACI) 2006 awards in Dubai.
 Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport, 18 kilometres (11.2 mi) north of the CBD, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes.
Adelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the  Adelaide Electric Supply Company, which was nationalised by the  Playford government in 1946, becoming the  Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA), now known as SA Power Networks. Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the  Olsen Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the  Cheung Kong Holdings for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP  Trevor Crothers resigned from the party and voted with the government. The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year. In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation. In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012. These price increases and large subsides have led to South Australia paying the highest retail price for electricity in the world.
SA Power Networks now distributes electricity from transmission companies to end users. Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Some of the major companies are:  TRUenergy, which generates electricity;  ElectraNet, which transmits electricity from the generators to the distribution network and  AGL Energy, which retails gas and electricity. Substantial investment has been made in maintenance and reinforcement of the electricity supply network to provide continued reliability of supply.
Adelaide derives most of its electricity from a gas-fired plant operated by  AGL Energy at  Torrens Island, with more coming from power stations at  Port Augusta and  Pelican Point, and from connections to the national grid. Gas is mainly supplied from the  Moomba Gas Processing Plant in the  Cooper Basin, and is piped to Adelaide and other areas within the state. South Australia also generates 18% of its electricity from  wind power, and has 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.
Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs:  Mount Bold,  Happy Valley,  Myponga,  Millbrook,  Hope Valley,  Little Para and  South Para. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the River Murray. A sea water desalination plant capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) is currently in construction and expected to be completed during 2012. The provision of water services is by the government-owned  SA Water.

Brisbane (pron.:  / ˈ b r ɪ z b ən /) is the  capital and most populous city in the Australian state of  Queensland and the  third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of 2.15 million, and the  South East Queensland  urban conurbation, centered on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the  Brisbane River, approximately 23 km (14 mi) from its mouth at  Moreton Bay. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the  floodplain of the Brisbane River valley between the bay and the  Great Dividing Range. While the metropolitan area is governed by several municipalities, a large portion of central Brisbane is governed by the  Brisbane City Council, which is by far Australia's largest  Local Government Area by population. The  demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.
Brisbane is named after the river on which it sits, which in turn was named after Scotsman  Sir Thomas Brisbane, the  Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825. The first European settlement in Queensland was a  penal colony at  Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17 mi) north of the Brisbane central business district, in 1824. That settlement was soon abandoned and moved to  North Quay in 1825. Free  settlers were permitted from 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from  New South Wales in 1859.
The city played a central role in the  Allied campaign during World War II as the  South West Pacific headquarters for  General Douglas MacArthur. Brisbane has hosted many large cultural and sporting events, including the  1982 Commonwealth Games,  World Expo '88 and the final  Goodwill Games in 2001. Brisbane is the largest economy between Sydney and Singapore, and as of 2008 is classified as a  Global city. It was also rated the 16th  most liveable city in the world in 2009 by the  Economist Intelligence Unit.
Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the  Turrbal and  Jagera people. They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning &quot;place shaped as a spike&quot;. The  Moreton Bay area was initially explored by  Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as  Woody Point, which he named &quot;Red Cliff Point&quot; after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823  Governor of New South Wales  Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern  penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by  John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.
Oxley discovered, named and explored the  Brisbane River as far as  Goodna, 20 kilometres (12 mi) upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore. The party settled in  Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as  North Quay, 28 kilometres (17 mi) south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane. Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838. German missionaries settled at Zions Hill,  Nundah as early as 1837, five years before Brisbane was officially declared a free settlement. The band consisted of ministers  Christopher Eipper (1813–1894) and  Carl Wilhelm Schmidt and lay missionaries Haussmann, Johann Gottried Wagner, Niquet, Hartenstein, Zillman, Franz, Rode, Doege and Schneider. They were allocated 260 hectares and set about establishing the mission, which became known as the German Station.
Free settlers entered the area over the following five years and by the end of 1840  Robert Dixon began work on the first plan of Brisbane Town, in anticipation of future development. Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony on 6 June 1859, with Brisbane chosen as its capital, although it was not incorporated as a city until 1902.
Over twenty small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925 to form the  City of Brisbane, governed by the  Brisbane City Council. 1930 was a significant year for Brisbane with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the  Shrine of Remembrance, in  ANZAC Square, which has become Brisbane's main  war memorial. These historic buildings, along with the  Story Bridge which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.
During World War II, Brisbane became central to the  Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called  MacArthur Central) was used as the  South West Pacific headquarters for  General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to  Hollandia in August 1944. MacArthur had previously rejected use of the University of Queensland complex as his headquarters, as the distinctive bends in the river at St Lucia could have aided enemy bombers. Also used as a headquarters by the American troops during World War II was the  T &amp; G Building. Approximately one million US troops passed through Australia during the war, as the primary coordination point for the  South West Pacific. In 1942 Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians which resulted in one death and several injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the  Battle of Brisbane.
Postwar Brisbane had developed a &quot;big country town&quot; stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove. In the late 1950s an anonymous poet known as The Brisbane Bard generated much attention on the city which helped shake this stigma. Despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The State government under  Joh Bjelke-Petersen began a major program of change and  urban renewal, beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs.  Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969, leaving Melbourne as the last Australian city to operate a tram network. The  1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernised rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost, including the Bellevue Hotel in 1979 and  Cloudland in 1982, demolished in controversial circumstances by the Deen Brothers demolition crew. Major public works included the  Riverside Expressway, the  Gateway Bridge, and later, the redevelopment of  South Bank, starting with the  Queensland Art Gallery.
Brisbane hosted the  1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 World Exposition (known locally as  World Expo 88). These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction and development not previously seen in the state of Queensland. Brisbane's population growth has exceeded the national average every year since 1990 at an average rate of around 2.2% per year.
After two decades of record population growth, Brisbane was again hit by a major  flood in January 2011. The Brisbane River did not reach the same height as the previous 1974 flood but still caused extensive damage and disruption to the city.
Brisbane is in the southeast corner of Queensland, Australia. The city is centred along the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the  Great Dividing Range. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the Moreton Bay floodplain from  Caboolture in the north to  Beenleigh in the south, and across to Ipswich in the south west.
The city of Brisbane is hilly. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the  Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of  Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 metres (980 ft) and the smaller  Enoggera Hill. Other prominent rises in Brisbane are  Mount Gravatt and nearby  Toohey Mountain.  Mount Petrie at 170 metres (560 ft) and the lower rises of  Highgate Hill,  Mount Ommaney,  Stephens Mountain and  Whites Hill are dotted across the city.
The city is on a low-lying  floodplain. Many suburban creeks criss-cross the city, increasing the risk of flooding. The city has suffered three major floods since colonisation, in  February 1893, January 1974, and  January 2011. The  1974 Brisbane flood occurred partly as a result of &quot; Cyclone Wanda&quot;. Heavy rain had fallen continuously for three weeks before the  Australia Day weekend flood (26 – 27 January 1974). The flood damaged many parts of the city, especially the suburbs of  Oxley,  Bulimba,  Rocklea,  Coorparoo,  Toowong and  New Farm. The  City Botanic gardens were inundated, leading to a new colony of  mangroves forming in the City Reach of the Brisbane River.
The Brisbane central business district (CBD) lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers 2.2 km2 (0.8 sq mi) and is walkable. Central streets are named after members of the  royal family.  Queen Street is Brisbane's traditional  main street. Streets named after female members ( Adelaide,  Alice,  Ann,  Charlotte,  Elizabeth,  Margaret,  Mary) run parallel to  Queen Street and  Queen Street Mall (named in honour of Queen Victoria) and perpendicular to streets named after male members ( Albert,  Edward,  George,  William). The city has retained some heritage buildings dating back to 1820s.  The Old Windmill, in  Wickham Park, built by convict labour in 1824, is the oldest surviving building in Brisbane. The Old Windmill was originally used for the grinding of grain and a punishment for the convicts who manually operated the grinding mill. The Old Windmill tower's other significant claim to fame, largely ignored, is that the first television signals in the southern hemisphere were transmitted from it by experimenters in April 1934 – long before TV commenced in most places. These experimental TV broadcasts continued until World War II. The Old Commissariat Store, on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used partly as a grainhouse, has also been a hostel for immigrants and used for the storage of records. Built with Brisbane  tuff from the nearby  Kangaroo Point Cliffs and sandstone from a quarry near today's Albion Park Racecourse, it is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane. It contains a museum and can also be hired for small functions. The city has a density of 379.4 people per square kilometre, which is high for an Australian city and comparable to that of Sydney. However like many western cities, Brisbane sprawls into the greater metropolitan area. This results from the fact that most of Brisbane's housing stock consists of detached houses.
Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few  terrace houses being constructed in Brisbane. Recently the density of the city and  inner city neighbourhoods has increased with the construction of apartments, with the result that the population of the central business district has doubled over the last 5 years. The high density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature  Queenslander-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles but are sometimes only one quarter the size. These miniature Queenslanders are becoming scarce but can still be seen in the inner city suburbs. Multi residence accommodations (such as apartment blocks) are relatively new to Brisbane, with few such blocks built before 1970, other than in inner suburbs such as  New Farm. Pre-1950 housing was often built in a distinctive architectural style known as a  Queenslander, featuring timber construction with large  verandahs and high ceilings. The relatively low cost of timber in South-East Queensland meant that until recently most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Many of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called &quot;stilts&quot;), that were originally timber, but are now frequently replaced by steel or concrete. Brisbane is home to several of  Australia's tallest buildings. Brisbane's tallest buildings are  Soleil at 243 metres,  Aurora Tower at 207 metres,  Riparian Plaza at 200 metres,  One One One Eagle Street at 195 metres, and  Infinity, at 262 metres, which is currently under construction.

        
Brisbane has a  humid subtropical climate ( Köppen climate classification Cfa) with warm to hot and humid summers and dry moderately warm winters. From November to March, thunderstorms are common over Brisbane, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds.
The city's highest recorded temperature was 43.2 °C (110 °F) on 26 January 1940. On 19 July 2007, Brisbane's temperature fell below the freezing point for the first time since records began, registering −0.1 °C (31.8 °F) at the airport. In 2009 Brisbane recorded its hottest winter day at 35.4 °C (95.7 °F) on 24 August. Brisbane's wettest day occurred on 21 January 1887, when 465 millimetres (18.3 in) of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of Australia's capital cities.
From 2001 until 2010, Brisbane and surrounding temperate areas had been experiencing the most severe drought in over a century, with dam levels dropping to 16.9% of their capacity on 10 August 2007. Residents were mandated by local laws to observe  level 6 water restrictions on gardening and other outdoor water usage. Per capita water usage is below 140 litres per day, giving Brisbane one of the lowest per capita usages of water of any developed city in the world. On 9 January 2011, an upper low crossed north of Brisbane and dropped rainfall on an already saturated southeast coast of Queensland, resulting in severe flooding and damage in Brisbane and the surrounding area; the same storm season also caused the water storage to climb to over 98% of maximum capacity and broke the drought. Water restrictions have been replaced with water conservation measures that aim at a target of 200 litres per day/per person, but consumption is rarely over 160 litres.  Dust storms in Brisbane are extremely rare; on 23 September 2009, however, a  severe dust storm blanketed Brisbane, as well as other parts of eastern Australia.
Brisbane also lies in the Tropical Cyclone risk area, although cyclones are rare. The last to affect Brisbane but not directly cross the city was Tropical Cyclone Hamish in March 2009: it remained approx 350 km (220 mi) north of Brisbane but caused significant damage to beaches as well as the worst oil spill in  Moreton Bay. Average annual temperature of the sea is 24 °C (75 °F), from 21 °C (70 °F) in July to 27 °C (81 °F) in February.
In November 2011, Brisbane saw 22 days with no recorded rainfall, which is the driest start to November since 1919.
August 2012 was the city's driest August and the driest month ever experienced in its recorded history (records at the  Brisbane Airport commenced in 1929, although the station closed in February 2000). At the meteorological station in the city's downtown core (Brisbane Station), only 0.2 mm of precipitation was recorded in August 2012.
Unlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area of Brisbane is controlled by a single  local government area, the  City of Brisbane. Since the creation of the City of Brisbane in 1925 the urban areas of Brisbane have expanded considerably past the council boundaries. The City is by far the largest local government body (in terms of population and budget) in Australia. It was formed by the merger of twenty smaller LGAs in 1925, and covers an area of 1,367 km2 (528 sq mi). The Council's annual budget is approximately AUD 1.6 billion, and it has an asset base of AUD 13 billion. The remainder of the metropolitan area falls into the LGAs of  Logan City to the south,  Moreton Bay Region in the northern suburbs, the  City of Ipswich to the south west,  Redland City to the south east on the bayside, with a small strip to the far west in the  Scenic Rim Region.
Brisbane has the largest economy of any city between Sydney and Singapore, which includes cities like Jakarta,  Darwin,  Townsville and  Cairns, and has seen consistent economic growth in recent years as a result of the resources boom. White-collar industries include information technology,  financial services, higher and  public sector administration generally concentrated in and around the central business district and recently established office areas in the inner suburbs. Blue-collar industries, including petroleum refining,  stevedoring, paper milling,  metalworking and  QR railway workshops, tend to be located on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River and in new industrial zones on the urban fringe. Tourism is an important part of the Brisbane economy, both in its own right and as a gateway to other areas of Queensland. The city is also investing in hotels to cater to the growing  Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions sector. Over 7,000 delegates and media are expected to visit Brisbane for the G20 Summit in November 2014.
Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Queensland State Government has been developing technology and science industries in Queensland as a whole, and Brisbane in particular, as part of its &quot;Smart State&quot; initiative. The government has invested in several biotechnology and research facilities at several universities in Brisbane. The  Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the  University of Queensland (UQ) Saint Lucia Campus is a large  CSIRO and Queensland state government initiative for research and innovation that is currently being emulated at the  Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Campus at Kelvin Grove with the establishment of the  Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI).
Brisbane is one of the major business hubs in Australia. Most major Australian companies, as well as numerous international companies, have contact offices in Brisbane, while numerous electronics businesses have distribution hubs in and around the city.  DHL Global's Oceanic distribution warehouse is located in Brisbane, as is  Asia Pacific Aerospace's headquarters. Home grown major companies include  Suncorp-Metway Limited,  Flight Centre,  Sunsuper,  Orrcon,  Credit Union Australia,  Boeing Australia,  Donut King,  Wotif.com,  WebCentral,  PIPE Networks,  Krome Studios,  NetBox Blue,  Mincom Limited,  TechnologyOne,  Thiess Pty Ltd and  Virgin Australia. Brisbane has the fourth highest  median household income of the Australian capital cities at AUD 57,772.
Brisbane has a range of retail precincts, both in the Central Business District and in surrounding suburbs. The  Queen Street Mall has a vast array of cafes, restaurants, cinemas, gift shops and shopping centres including:  Wintergarden,  Broadway on the Mall,  QueensPlaza,  Brisbane Arcade, Queen Adelaide Building, Tattersalls Arcade and  The Myer Centre. Edward St, in the city, is home to many luxury international retailers, such as  Louis Vuitton,  Tiffany and Co.,  Hermès,  Gucci,  Bally,  Montblanc,  Canali,  Maxmara,  Oroton,  Polo Ralph Lauren,  Bvlgari, and  Hugo Boss. The majority of retail business is done within the suburbs of Brisbane in shopping centres which include major department store chains. The largest shopping centres by area are located in the suburbs of  Chermside,  Upper Mount Gravatt,  Carindale and  Indooroopilly. Other large shopping centres are located in  Toombul ( Centro Toombul),  Mitchelton ( Brookside Shopping Centre),  North Lakes ( Westfield North Lakes),  Strathpine ( Westfield Strathpine) and  Loganholme ( Logan Hyperdome).
The  Port of Brisbane is on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River and on Fisherman's Island at the rivers mouth, and is the 3rd most important port in Australia for value of goods.  Container freight, sugar, grain, coal and bulk liquids are the major exports. Most of the port facilities are less than three decades old and some are built on reclaimed  mangroves and  wetlands.
The Port is a part of the  Australia TradeCoast, the country's fastest-growing economic development area. Geographically, Australia TradeCoast occupies a large swathe of land around the airport and port. Commercially, the area has attracted a mix of companies from throughout the Asia Pacific region.
The Greater Capital City Statistical Area of Brisbane includes much of Brisbane's Local Government Area as well as the cities of  Ipswich,  Moreton Bay,  Logan City and  Redland City which demographically are part of a single  conurbation. The 2011 census reported 2,065,996 residents within the Brisbane GCCSA, making it the  third largest city in Australia. Brisbane recorded the second highest growth rate of all capital cities since the previous Census, growing by 11.5%.
The 2011 census showed that 2% of Brisbane's population were of indigenous origin and 29.7% were  born overseas. Of those born outside of Australia, the three main countries of birth were the United Kingdom, New Zealand and India. Approximately 17.9% of households spoke a language other than English, with the most common languages being Mandarin 1.5%, Vietnamese 0.9%, Cantonese 0.9%, Samoan 0.6% and Spanish 0.5%.
Areas with significant overseas-born populations predominate in the southern suburbs and inner Brisbane. By far the largest ethnic minority are  Asian Australians. The area around  Sunnybank,  Sunnybank Hills,  Stretton and  Robertson is home to a large proportion of Brisbane's Hong Kong and Taiwanese-born. Brisbane's ethnic Chinese population has traditionally been dominated by those with origins in Taiwan and Hong Kong, still far more prevalent than in Sydney and Melbourne where Mainland Chinese are more numerous. Those with origins in China, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries are more spread around the metropolitan area. Brisbane has the highest population of  Taiwanese Australian citizens of any city in Australia, with Sunnybank and its surrounding suburbs dubbed &quot;Taiwan Town&quot; and &quot;Little Taipei&quot;. Brisbane has the highest proportion of Korean Australians outside of Sydney. A significant proportion of Brisbane's Vietnamese population reside in the suburbs of  Darra and  Inala.  Moorooka is home to many residents of African descent. The inner southern suburbs were considered the most densely populated with people of Southern European heritage.  New Farm was historically home to many of Brisbane's early Italian community. There are also a large number of  Indians,  Filipinos,  Pakistanis,  German Australians, Papua New Guineans,  Fijians and other  Pacific Islander communities in the city.
Brisbane has multi-campus universities and colleges including the  University of Queensland,  Queensland University of Technology and  Griffith University, all among Australia's highest rated universities. Other universities which have campuses in Brisbane include the  Australian Catholic University,  Central Queensland University,  James Cook University,  JMC Academy,  University of Southern Queensland and the  University of the Sunshine Coast.
There are three major  TAFE colleges in Brisbane; the  Brisbane North Institute of TAFE, the  Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE, and the  Southbank Institute of TAFE. Brisbane is also home to numerous other  independent tertiary providers, including the  Australian College of Natural Medicine, the  Brisbane College of Theology,  QANTM, as well as  Jschool: Journalism Education &amp; Training.
Many of Brisbane's  preschool, primary, and secondary schools are under the jurisdiction of Education Queensland, a branch of the  Queensland Government. There are also a large number of independent (private), Roman Catholic, and other Christian run schools.

        
Brisbane has a substantial live music scene, both popular and classical. The  Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC), which is located at  South Bank, consists of the Lyric Theatre, a Concert Hall, Cremorne Theatre and the Playhouse Theatre and is home to the  Queensland Ballet,  Opera Queensland,  Queensland Theatre Company, and the  Queensland Symphony Orchestra. The  Queensland Conservatorium, in which professional companies and Conservatorium students also stage performances, is located within the  South Bank Parklands. Numerous choirs present performances across the city annually. These choirs include the Brisbane Chorale, Queensland Choir, Brisbane Chamber Choir, Canticum Chamber Choir, Brisbane Concert Choir, Imogen Children's Chorale and  Brisbane Birralee Voices. Due to the lack of a suitable purpose built performance venue for choral music, these choirs typically perform in the city's many churches.
The  Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), opened in December 2006, is one of the latest additions to the  South Bank precinct and houses some of the most well-known pieces of modern art from within and outside Australia. GOMA is the largest modern art gallery in Australia. GOMA holds the Asia Pacific Triennial (APT) which focuses on contemporary art from the Asia and Pacific in a variety of media from painting to video work. In Addition, its size enables the gallery to exhibit particularly large shows — the Andy Warhol exhibition being the largest survey of his work in Australia. GOMA also boasts Australia's largest purpose-built Cinémathèque. The Gallery of Modern Art is located next to the  State Library of Queensland and the  Queensland Art Gallery. Along with Beijing, Berlin, Birmingham and Marseille, Brisbane was nominated as one of the Top 5 International Music Hotspots by Billboard in 2007. There are also popular entertainment pubs and clubs within both the  City and  Fortitude Valley.
The  Brisbane Powerhouse in New Farm and the  Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts on Brunswick Street in Fortitude Valley also feature diverse programs featuring exhibitions and festivals of visual art, music and dance. The  La Boite Theatre Company performs at the Roundhouse Theatre at Kelvin Grove.  Twelfth Night Theatre at Bowen Hills is also a professional theatre. There are numerous amateur theatre groups in Brisbane. The oldest is the  Brisbane Arts Theatre which was founded in 1936. It has a regular adult and children's theatre and is located in Petrie Terrace.
Major cultural events in Brisbane include the  Ekka (the Royal Queensland Exhibition), held each August, and the  Riverfestival, held each September at  South Bank Parklands and surrounding areas. Warana, (meaning Blue Skies), was a former spring festival which began in 1961 and was held in September each year. Run as a celebration of Brisbane, Warana was similar to Melbourne's  Moomba festival. In 1996 the annual festival was changed to a  biennial Brisbane Festival. The  Brisbane International Film Festival (BIFF) is held in July/August in a variety of venues around Brisbane. BIFF features new films and retrospectives by domestic and international filmmakers along with seminars and awards.
The Paniyiri festival at  Musgrave Park (corner of Russell and Edmondstone Streets,  South Brisbane) is an annual Greek cultural festival held over two days in May. The Brisbane Medieval Fayre and Tournament is held each June in  Musgrave Park. The Valley Fiesta is an annual three-day event organised by the Valley Chamber of Commerce. It was launched by Brisbane Marketing in 2002 to promote Fortitude Valley as a hub for arts and youth culture. It features free live music, market stalls, food and drink from many local restaurants and cafés, and other entertainment. The  Bridge to Brisbane fun run has become a major annual charity event for Brisbane. The  Caxton Street Seafood and Wine Festival was launched in 1994 by the Caxton Street Development Association to promote Caxton Street in historic Petrie Terrace as a significant entertainment precinct that celebrates and promotes Australian music, seafood and wine. It features live music, food and drink from Caxton Street restaurants and cafés, as well as Art Exhibitions and Historical Displays and a dedicated annual Festival Band Competition.
Tourism plays a major role in Brisbane's economy, being the third-most popular destination for international tourists after Sydney and Melbourne. Popular tourist and recreation areas in Brisbane include the  South Bank Parklands,  Roma Street Parkland, the  City Botanic Gardens,  Brisbane Forest Park and  Portside Wharf. The  Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary opened in 1927 and was the world's first koala sanctuary.
The suburb of  Mount Coot-tha is home to a popular state forest, and the  Brisbane Botanic Gardens which houses the  Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium and the &quot;Tsuki-yama-chisen&quot; Japanese Garden (formerly of the Japanese Government Pavilion of Brisbane's  World Expo '88).
Brisbane has over 27 km (16.8 mi) of bicycle pathways, mostly surrounding the  Brisbane river and city centre, extending to the west of the city. The river itself was popular with bathers, and it permitted boating excursions to Moreton Bay when the main port was in the city reaches. Today fishing and boating are more common. Other popular recreation activities include the  Story Bridge adventure climb and  rock climbing at the Kangaroo Point cliffs.
The nearby  Australia Zoo, made famous by  Steve Irwin, also encourages many tourists to visit Brisbane.

        
Brisbane has hosted several major sporting events including the  1982 Commonwealth Games and the 2001  Goodwill Games. The city also hosted events during the  1987 Rugby World Cup,  1992 Cricket World Cup,  2000 Sydney Olympics, the  2003 Rugby World Cup and hosted the Final of the  2008 Rugby League World Cup and will host along with the  Gold Coast, some events for the  2018 Commonwealth Games. In 2005, then  Premier  Peter Beattie announced plans for Brisbane to bid to host the  2024 Olympic Games, which in August 2008 received in principle  Australian Olympic Committee support, including that of the Queensland Premier  Anna Bligh and Brisbane Lord Mayor  Campbell Newman. The most popular professional club in the city is the  Brisbane Broncos, who play in the  National Rugby League competition. Brisbane also hosts a professional football (soccer) team named  Brisbane Roar Football Club. They are in the  Hyundai A-League.
The city's major sporting venues include  Brisbane Cricket Ground,  Sleeman Centre at  Chandler,  Lang Park,  Ballymore Stadium and the stadium facilities of the  Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre in  Nathan. With the closure of the Milton Tennis grounds in 1994, Brisbane lacked a major tennis facility. In 2005, the State Government approved the  State Tennis Centre a new A$65 million tennis stadium. The construction was completed in 2008. The  Brisbane International is held here from January 2009.
Brisbane has teams in all major interstate competitions, excluding the  National Basketball League.
Brisbane is covered by  Queensland Health's &quot;Northside&quot; and &quot;Southside&quot; health service areas. Within the greater Brisbane area there are 8 major  public hospitals, 4 major  private hospitals, and smaller public and private facilities. Specialist and  general medical practices are located in the CBD, and most suburbs and localities.
Brisbane has an extensive transportation network within the city, as well as connections to regional centres, interstate and to overseas destinations. The use of urban public transport is still only a small component of total passenger transport, the largest component being travel by private car.
Public transport is provided by bus, rail and ferry services. Bus services are operated by public and private operators whereas trains and ferries are operated by public agencies. The  Brisbane central business district (CBD) is the central hub for all public transport services with services focusing on  Queen Street Bus Station,  Roma Street and  Central railway stations, and various city ferries wharves. Brisbane's  CityCat high speed ferry service, popular with tourists and commuters, operates services along the  Brisbane River between the  University of Queensland and Apollo Road.
The  Citytrain urban rail network consists of 10 suburban lines and covers mostly the west, north and east sides of the city. It also provides the route for an  Airtrain service under joint public/private control between the City and  Brisbane Airport. Since 2000, Brisbane has been developing a  busway network, including the  South East Busway,  Northern Busway and the  Eastern Busway.  TransLink operates an  integrated ticketing system across the public transport network.
The Brisbane River has created a barrier to some road transport routes. In total there are  ten road bridges, mostly concentrated in the inner city area. This has intensified the need for transport routes to focus on the inner city. There are also three railway bridges and two pedestrian bridges. The  Eleanor Schonell Bridge (originally named, and still generally known as, The Green Bridge) between the University of Queensland and  Dutton Park is for use by buses, pedestrians and cyclists. There are currently multiple tunnel and bridge projects underway as part of the  TransApex plan.
An extensive network of pedestrian and cyclist pathways have been created along the banks of the  Brisbane River to form a  Riverwalk network.
Brisbane is served by several urban and inter-urban motorways. The  Pacific Motorway connects the central city with the  Gold Coast to the south. The  Ipswich Motorway connects the city with Ipswich to the west via the southern suburbs, while the  Western Freeway and the  Centenary Motorway provide a connection between Brisbane's inner-west and the outer south-west, connecting with the Ipswich Motorway south of the Brisbane River. The  Bruce Highway is Brisbane's main route north of the city to the rest of the State. The Bruce Highway terminates 1,700 km (1,056 mi) away in  Cairns and passes through most major cities along the Queensland coast. The  Gateway Motorway is a private  toll road which connects the Gold Coast and  Sunshine Coasts by providing an alternate route via the  Gateway Bridge avoiding Brisbane's inner city area. The Port of Brisbane Motorway links the Gateway to the Port of Brisbane, while Inner City Bypass and the Riverside Expressway act as the inner ring freeway system to prevent motorists from travelling through the city's congested centre.
Brisbane's population growth placed strains on South East Queensland's transport system. The State Government and Brisbane City Council have responded with infrastructure plans and increased funding for transportation projects, such as the  South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program. Most of the focus has been placed on expanding current road infrastructure, particularly tunnels and bypasses, as well as improving the public transport system.
 Brisbane Airport (IATA code: BNE) is the city's main airport, the  third busiest in Australia after  Sydney Airport and  Melbourne Airport. It is located north-east of the city centre and provides domestic and international passenger services. In the 2008–2009 year, Brisbane Airport handled over 18.5 million passengers. The airport is serviced by  the Brisbane Airtrain which provides a rail service from Brisbane's city centre to and from the airport.  Archerfield Airport (in Brisbane's southern suburbs) acts as a  general aviation airport.

        
Water storage, treatment and delivery for Brisbane is handled by  SEQ Water, which sells on to  Queensland Urban Utilities (previously Brisbane Water) for distribution to the greater Brisbane area. Water for the area is stored in one of three dams;  Wivenhoe,  Somerset and  North Pine. Since 13 May 2005, Brisbane has enforced  water restrictions due to drought. This has also led to the State Government announcing that purified recycled water would be pumped into the dams once the pipeline was complete in 2009. More recently, restrictions were lifted and water conservation is no longer a major concern of council, although residents are asked to follow permanent conservation measures.
Electricity and gas grids in Brisbane are handled by  Energex (electricity), and  Origin Energy (gas), with each company previously holding a monopoly on domestic retail supply. Since 1 July 2007 Queensland regulation changes have opened up the retail energy market, allowing multiple companies to resell both gas and electricity.
Metropolitan Brisbane is serviced by all major and most minor telecommunications companies and their networks. Brisbane has the largest number of enabled  DSL telephone exchanges in Queensland. An increasing number are also enabled with special hardware ( DSLAMs) which enable high speed  ADSL2+ internet access. The Brisbane CBD also features a complete underground fibre optics network, with numerous connections to the inner suburbs provided by various service providers.
 Telstra and  Optus provide both high speed internet as well as  Pay TV through their cable services for the bulk of the city's metropolitan area. Both of these providers also host wireless networks with  hotspots within both the inner and suburban areas. In addition,  3 Mobile,  Telstra,  Optus and Vodafone all operate both  2.5G,  3G and  3.5G mobile phone networks citywide.
&quot;Bris Vegas&quot; is an ironic nickname given to the city. This has been attributed to an Elvis Presley tribute CD and the city's growing live music scene. It is believed to have been first used in print in a 1996 edition of  The Courier-Mail, also approximately the time of the opening of the  Treasury Casino in Brisbane and the popularisation of poker machines in Brisbane bars and clubs, a play on the popular gaming ground of Las Vegas. The name has also been attributed to the city's nightlife, compact size of the central business district and previous perceived lack of sophistication, a comparison to the ostensibly crass Las Vegas, Nevada.
Brisbane is the setting for the Australian TV series  Slide.

Canberra (pron.:  / ˈ k æ n b ᵊ r ə / or  / ˈ k æ n b ɛr ə /) is the  capital city of Australia. With a population of 367,000, it is Australia's largest inland city and the  eighth-largest city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the  Australian Capital Territory (ACT), 280 km (170 mi) south-west of Sydney, and 660 km (410 mi) north-east of Melbourne. A resident of Canberra is known as a &quot;Canberran&quot;.
The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two  largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely  planned city outside of any state, similar to the American Federal District of Columbia. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by the Chicago architects  Walter Burley Griffin and  Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred around axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory.
The city's design was influenced by the  garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title of the &quot;bush capital&quot;. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a sequence of bodies that were to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister  Robert Menzies championed its development and the  National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the federal government retains some influence through the  National Capital Authority.
As the seat of the  government of Australia, Canberra is the site of  Parliament House, the  High Court and numerous government departments and agencies. It is also the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance, such as the  Australian War Memorial,  Australian National University,  Australian Institute of Sport,  National Gallery,  National Museum and the  National Library. The Australian Army's officer corps are trained at the  Royal Military College, Duntroon and the  Australian Defence Force Academy is also located in the capital.
The ACT, like Washington, D.C. in the United States, is independent of any state, to prevent any one state from gaining an advantage by hosting the seat of Federal power. Unlike Washington, however, the ACT has voting representation in the Federal Parliament, and has its own independent  Legislative Assembly and government, similar to the states.
As the city has a high proportion of public servants, the federal government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra. As the seat of government, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher than the national average, while property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively restricted development regulations. Tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger.
The word &quot;Canberra&quot; is popularly claimed to derive from the word Kambera or Canberry and mean &quot;meeting place&quot; in the old  Ngunnawal language of the local  Ngabri people.
Alternatively, the name was reported by  Queanbeyan newspaper owner  John Gale in the 1860s to be an anglicisation of the indigenous name 'nganbra' or 'nganbira', meaning &quot;hollow between a woman's breasts&quot;, and referring to the  Sullivans Creek floodplain between  Mount Ainslie and  Black Mountain.
Before European settlement, the area in which Canberra would eventually be constructed was seasonally inhabited by  Indigenous Australians. Anthropologist  Norman Tindale suggested the principal group occupying the region were the  Ngunnawal people, while the  Ngarigo lived immediately to the south of the ACT, The Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south,  Gandangara people to the north, and  Wiradjuri to the north west. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites, and stone tools and arrangements. The evidence suggests human habitation in the area for at least 21,000 years.
European exploration and settlement started in the Canberra area as early as the 1820s. There were four expeditions between 1820 and 1824. White settlement of the area probably dates from 1823, when a homestead or station was built on what is now the Acton peninsula by stockmen employed by Joshua John Moore. He formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826, naming the property &quot;Canberry&quot;. On 30 April 1827, Moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of 1,000 acres (405 ha) at Canberry.
The European population in the Canberra area continued to grow slowly throughout the 19th century. Among them was the Campbell family of &quot;Duntroon&quot;; their imposing stone house is now the officers' mess of the  Royal Military College, Duntroon. The Campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of &quot; Weetangera&quot;. Other notable early settlers included the inter-related Murray and Gibbes families, who owned the Yarralumla estate—now the site of the  official residence of the  Governor-General of Australia—from the 1830s through to 1881.
The oldest surviving public building in the inner-city is the Anglican Church of  St John the Baptist, in the suburb of Reid, which was consecrated in 1845. St John's churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district. As the European presence increased, the indigenous population dwindled, mainly from disease such as smallpox and measles.
The district's change from a rural area in  New South Wales to the national capital started during debates over  Federation in the late 19th century. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least 100 miles (160 km) from Sydney, with Melbourne to be the temporary seat of government (but not referred to as the &quot;capital&quot;) while the new capital was built. Newspaper proprietor  John Gale circulated a pamphlet titled ' Dalgety or Canberra: Which?' advocating Canberra to every member of the Commonwealth's seven States Parliaments. By many accounts, it was decisive in the selection of Canberra as the site in 1908, as was a result of survey work done by the government  surveyor  Charles Scrivener. The NSW government ceded the Federal Capital Territory (as it was then known) to the federal government. In an international design competition conducted by the Department of Home Affairs, on 24 May 1911, the design by  Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was chosen for the city, and in 1913 Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began.
On 12 March 1913, the city was officially given its name by  Lady Denman, the wife of Governor-General  Lord Denman, at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill, which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present  Parliament House.  Canberra Day is a public holiday observed in the ACT on the second Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra. After the ceremony, bureaucratic disputes hindered Griffin's work; a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials. Griffin's relationship with the Australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in 1920, little work had been done. By this time, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of major avenues, and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.
The federal legislature moved to Canberra on 9 May 1927, with the opening of the  Provisional Parliament House. The Prime Minister,  Stanley Bruce, had officially taken up residence in  The Lodge a few days earlier. Planned development of the city slowed significantly during the  depression of the 1930s and during World War II. Some projects planned for that time, including  Roman Catholic and  Anglican cathedrals, were never completed.
From 1920 to 1957, three bodies, successively the  Federal Capital Advisory Committee, the  Federal Capital Commission, and the  National Capital Planning and Development Committee continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra in the absence of Griffin; however, they were only advisory, and development decisions were made without consulting them, increasing inefficiency.
Immediately after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village, and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly. Canberra was often derisively described as &quot;several suburbs in search of a city&quot;. Prime Minister  Robert Menzies regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city for poor performance. He ruled for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly. The population grew by more than 50% in every five-year period from 1955 to 1975. Several Government departments, together with public servants, were moved to Canberra from Melbourne following the war.  Government housing projects were undertaken to accommodate the city's growing population.
Most of rapid expansion was achieved after the  National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) was formed in 1957 with executive powers, replacing its ineffective advisory predecessors. The NCDC ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin—the centrepiece of Griffin's design—and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the lake finally the laid the platform for the development of Griffin's  Parliamentary Triangle. Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores.
The newly built  Australian National University was expanded, and sculptures and monuments were built. A new  National Library was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle, followed by the  High Court and the  National Gallery. Suburbs in  Canberra Central (often referred to as  North Canberra and  South Canberra) were further developed in the 1950s, and urban development in the  districts of  Woden Valley and  Belconnen commenced in the mid and late 1960s respectively. Many of the new suburbs were named after Australian politicians, such as  Barton,  Deakin,  Reid,  Braddon,  Curtin,  Chifley and  Parkes.
On 27 January 1972 the  Aboriginal Tent Embassy was first established by indigenous people on the grounds of Parliament House; it was created to draw attention to indigenous rights and land issues and has been continuously occupied since 1992.
On 9 May 1988, a larger and permanent Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations, and the Federal Parliament moved there from the Provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.
In December 1988, the ACT was granted full self-government through an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament. Following the first election on 4 March 1989, a 17-member  Legislative Assembly sat at temporary offices at 1 Constitution Avenue, Civic, on 11 May 1989. Permanent premises were opened on London Circuit in 1994. The  Australian Labor Party formed the ACT's first government, led by the Chief Minister  Rosemary Follett, who made history as Australia's first female head of government.
Parts of Canberra were engulfed by  bushfires on 18 January 2003 that killed four people, injured 435, and destroyed more than 500 homes and the major research telescopes of Australian National University's  Mount Stromlo Observatory. Throughout 2013, several events will be held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra.
Canberra covers an area of 814.2 square kilometres (314.3 sq. mi) and is located near the  Brindabella Ranges, approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi) inland from  Australia's east coast. It has an elevation of approximately 580 metres (1,900 ft)  AHD; the highest point is  Mount Majura at 888 metres (2,913 ft). Other large hills include  Mount Taylor 855 metres (2,805 ft),  Mount Ainslie 843 metres (2,765 ft), Mount Mugga Mugga 812 metres (2,664 ft) and  Black Mountain 812 metres (2,664 ft).
The native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly  eucalypt species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including  Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.
The urban environs of the city of Canberra straddle the  Ginninderra plain,  Molonglo plain, the Limestone plain, and the  Tuggeranong plain (Isabella's Plain). The  Molonglo River which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capital's iconic feature Lake Burley Griffin. The Molonglo then flows into the  Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The  Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.
A number of creeks, including Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, flow into the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee. Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes  Ginninderra and  Tuggeranong. Until recently the Molonglo River had a history of sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.
Canberra has a relatively dry oceanic climate with warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Canberra experiences warm, quite dry summers, and chilly winters with heavy fog and frequent frosts. Snow is rare in the CBD (central business district), but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow capped mountains can be seen from the CBD. The highest recorded maximum temperature was 42.2 °C (108.0 °F) on 1 February 1968.
The lowest recorded minimum temperature was −10 °C (14 °F) on 11 July 1971. Light snow often falls only once or twice per year but is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates. Canberra is protected from the west by the  Brindabellas which create a slight rain shadow in Canberra's valleys.
Annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and  Hobart) but is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall. Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April, owing to the effect of summer and the mountains. The area is not very windy and the breeze is at its strongest from August to November. Canberra is less humid than the nearby coastal areas.
Canberra is a  planned city and the inner-city area was originally designed by  Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.
Lake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from  Capital Hill—the eventual location of the new  Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along  Anzac Parade to the  Australian War Memorial. This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of  Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was  Bimberi Peak, the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately 52 km south west of Canberra.
The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards  Black Mountain. A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis. The municipal axis became the location of  Constitution Avenue, which links  City Hill in  Civic Centre and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill.  Commonwealth Avenue and  Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the  Parliamentary Triangle, and formed the centrepiece of Griffin's work.
The Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and  Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Walter's dismissal by Prime Minister  Billy Hughes after the war ended.
The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven residential districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
The Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs. In 1967 the then  National Capital Development Commission adopted the &quot;Y Plan&quot; which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y, with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.
Development in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through planning processes and the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99 year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised.
Many of Canberra's  suburbs are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.  Street names typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of  Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of  Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of  Page are named after biologists and naturalists. Most  diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of Yarralumla,  Deakin and  O'Malley. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of  Fyshwick,  Mitchell and  Hume.
Outside Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory has no settlements larger than a village. The  Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly performs the roles of both a  city council and territory government. The assembly consists of 17 members, elected from three districts using proportional representation. The three districts are  Molonglo,  Ginninderra and  Brindabella, which elect seven, five and five members, respectively.
The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 21-year history, mostly during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, when Labor won power. At the 2004 election the  Australian Labor Party, headed by then Chief Minister  Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT's first majority government, but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government with the  Greens.
As almost all of the ACT's population lives in Canberra, political trends for both areas are closely aligned. The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the  Division of Australian Capital Territory. The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two.
A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution. Both House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor, usually by comfortable margins. Labor has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberals at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and the  Liberal Party of Australia have always held one Senate seat each.
The Australian federal government retains some influence over the ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through the actions of the  National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin's plan for the city, such as the Parliamentary Triangle, Lake Burley Griffin, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park). The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the  Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly.
The  Australian Federal Police (AFP) provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces, under a contractual agreement with the ACT Government. The AFP does so through its community policing arm, ACT Policing ( Australian Capital Territory Police).
People who have been charged with offences are tried either in the  ACT Magistrates Court or for more severe offences, the  ACT Supreme Court. Prisoners were held in  remand at the  Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually jailed in New South Wales. The new prison,  Alexander Maconochie Centre, was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by  Jon Stanhope, the Chief Minister. The total cost for construction was $130 million. Courts such as a Small Claims Tribunal and a  Family Court exist for civil law actions and other non-criminal legal matters.
In May 2012, the unemployment rate in Canberra was 3.4% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city. The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is  $1,554.50 compared with the national average of $1,345.20 (February 2012).
The median house price in Canberra as of September 2009 was $511,820, lower than only Sydney among capital cities of more than 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005. The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories. As at the March quarter of 2009 the median rent in Canberra was $420 per week, the third highest in the country. Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply, and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.
The city's main industry is government administration and defence, which accounted for 31% of Gross Territory Product in 2008–09 and employed over 40% of Canberra's workforce. A number of  Australian Defence Force establishments are located in or near Canberra, most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and  HMAS Harman, which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri-service, multi-user depot.
The former  RAAF Fairbairn, adjacent to the Canberra International Airport was sold to the operators of the Airport, but the base continues to be used for  RAAF VIP flights. A growing number of independent software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to capitalise on the concentration of government customers; these include  Tower Software and  RuleBurst. A consortium of private and government investors is currently making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region.
As of 2006, the population of Canberra was 323,056 people. The 2006 census showed that 1.2% of Canberra's population were of indigenous origin and 21.7% were born overseas. The largest group of people born overseas came from English-speaking countries, led by the United Kingdom and then New Zealand.
Significant numbers of immigrants have also come from China, India and Vietnam. Recent immigrants have arrived from countries in  East and South Asia. Most locals are native speakers of  English (81.1%); some have a second language, the most common being Mandarin, Italian, Vietnamese, Cantonese and Greek. These five languages are spoken by a total of 4.8% of the population.
Canberrans are relatively young, highly  mobile, and well educated. The median age is 34 years, and only 9.8% of the population is aged over 65 years. Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved to or from Canberra, which is the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city.
As of May 2004, 30% of people in the ACT aged 15–64 had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a  bachelor's degree, significantly higher that the national average of 19%. Approximately 60% of Canberra residents describe themselves as Christian, the most common denominations being Catholic and Anglican; 6% of the population practice a non-Christian religion and 23% are not religious.
As of 2002 the most common crimes in Canberra are property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and  motor vehicle theft. They affect 1,961 and 630 of every 100,000 persons respectively.  Homicide and related offences—including murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and driving causing death—affect 1.5/100,000 persons, which is below the national average of 4.9/100,000. Rates of assault and  sexual assault are also below the national average.
The two main tertiary institutions are the  Australian National University (ANU) in  Acton and the  University of Canberra (UC) in  Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by  The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of  Watson is a campus of the  Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in  Barton is part of the secular  Charles Sturt University.
The  Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the  Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of  Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and  postgraduates and is a campus of the  University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides  Australian Army  officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus  Canberra Institute of Technology.
In February 2004 there were 140  schools in Canberra; 96 were operated by the government and 44 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.
Canberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the  Australian War Memorial, the  National Gallery of Australia, the  National Portrait Gallery, the  National Library, the  National Archives, the  Australian Academy of Science, the  National Film and Sound Archive and the  National Museum. Many Commonwealth government buildings in Canberra are open to the public, including  Parliament House, the  High Court and the  Royal Australian Mint.
Lake Burley Griffin is the site of the  Captain James Cook Memorial and the  National Carillon. Other sites of interest include the  Black Mountain Tower, the  Australian National Botanic Gardens, the  National Zoo and Aquarium, the  National Dinosaur Museum and  Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre.
The  Canberra Museum and Gallery in  the city is a repository of local history and art. Several historic homes are open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the  Tuggeranong Valley, Mugga-Mugga in  Symonston, and Blundells' Cottage in  Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers. Calthorpes' House in  Red Hill is a well preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days. Canberra has many venues for live music and theatre: the  Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions; and Llewellyn Hall (within the  ANU School of Music), a world-class concert hall are two of the most notable. The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings.  The Albert Hall was the city's first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society.
 Stonefest at the University of Canberra is a large two-day music festival. There are numerous bars and nightclubs which also offer live entertainment, particularly concentrated in the areas of  Dickson,  Kingston and  the city. Most town centres have facilities for a community theatre and a cinema, and they all have a library. Popular cultural events include the  National Folk Festival, the  Royal Canberra Show, the  Summernats car festival, the Canberra Multicultural Festival in February and the Celebrate Canberra festival held over 10 days in March in conjunction with Canberra Day.
Canberra maintains sister-city relationships with both  Nara, Japan and Beijing, China. Canberra has friendship-city relationships with both  Dili, East Timor and  Hangzhou, China. City-to-city relationships encourage communities and special interest groups both locally and abroad to engage in a wide range of exchange activities. The Canberra Nara Candle Festival held annually in spring, is a community celebration of the Canberra Nara Sister City relationship. The festival is held in Canberra Nara Park on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin.
In addition to local sporting leagues, Canberra has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and international competitions. The best known teams are the  Canberra Raiders and the  Brumbies who play rugby league and rugby union respectively; both have been champions of their leagues. Both teams play their home games at  Canberra Stadium, which is the city's largest stadium and was used to hold group matches in soccer for the  2000 Summer Olympics and in rugby union for the  2003 Rugby World Cup. The city also has a successful basketball team, the  Canberra Capitals, which has won seven out of the last eleven  national women's basketball titles.  Canberra United FC represents the city in the  W-League, the national  women's association football league, and were champions in the  2011-12 season.
There are also teams that participate in national competitions in  netball,  field hockey,  ice hockey,  cricket and  baseball.  Manuka Oval is another large outdoor sporting facility where cricket and  Australian Rules football are played. The Melbourne based  AFL team the  Kangaroos played some home games at Manuka Oval until July 2006. Following the move of the Kangaroos' alternative home ground to  Carrara in Queensland,  Melbourne and the  Western Bulldogs will play home games at Manuka Oval from 2007 against the  Sydney Swans. Canberra is also home to the  Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament. The historic  Prime Minister's XI cricket match is played at Manuka Oval annually. Other significant annual sporting events include the  Canberra Marathon and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon. The  Canberra Women's Tennis Classic was held in the lead up to the Australian Open until 2006.
The  Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is located in the Canberra suburb of  Bruce. The AIS is a specialised educational and training institution providing coaching for elite junior and senior athletes in a number of sports. The AIS has been operating since 1981 and has achieved significant success in producing elite athletes, both local and international. The majority of Australia's team members and medallists at the  2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney were AIS graduates.
Canberra has numerous sporting ovals, golf courses, skate parks, tennis courts and swimming pools that are open to the public. A Canberra-wide series of bicycle paths are available to cyclists for recreational and sporting purposes. Canberra Nature Parks have a large range of walking paths, horse and mountain bike trails. Water sports like sailing, rowing, dragon boating and water skiing are held on Canberra's lakes. The Rally of Canberra is an annual motor sport event and a facility for  drag racing is currently being planned for construction.
Canberra has two large public hospitals, the approximately 600-bed  Canberra Hospital—formerly the Woden Valley Hospital—in  Garran and the 174-bed Calvary Public Hospital in  Bruce. Both are teaching institutions. The largest private hospital is the Calvary John James Hospital in  Deakin. Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and  Healthscope's National Capital Private Hospital in Garran are also major healthcare providers.
The  Royal Canberra Hospital was located on  Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin; it was closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1997 in a  controversial and fatal implosion to facilitate construction of the  National Museum of Australia. The city has 10 aged care facilities. Canberra's hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales, and  ACT Ambulance Service is one of four operational agencies of the  ACT Emergency Services Authority.  NETS provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter-hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales.
The automobile is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.
 Canberra's districts are generally connected by  parkways—limited access  dual carriageway roads with speed limits generally set at a maximum of 100 km/h. An example is the  Tuggeranong Parkway which links Canberra's CBD and Tuggeranong, and bypasses Weston Creek. In most districts, discrete residential suburbs are bounded by main arterial roads with only a few residential linking in, to deter non-local traffic from cutting through areas of housing.
 ACTION, the government-operated bus service, provides public transport throughout the city. Deane's Transit Group provides bus services between Canberra and nearby areas of New South Wales through their  Transborder Express ( Murrumbateman and  Yass) and  Deane's Buslines ( Queanbeyan) brands. In the 2006 census, 7.7% of the journeys to work involved a bus; with 7.4% walking or cycling to work. There are two local taxi companies.  Aerial Capital Group enjoyed monopoly status until the arrival of Cabxpress in 2007.
An interstate  CountryLink railway service connects Canberra to Sydney.  Canberra's railway station is in the inner south suburb of  Kingston. Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre, although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt, while plans for a line to  Yass were abandoned. A  1067 mm gauge construction railway was built in 1923 between the  Yarralumla brickworks and the provisional Parliament House; it was later extended to Civic, but the whole line was closed in May 1927. Train services to Melbourne are provided by way of a CountryLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in Yass, about one hour's drive from Canberra.
Plans to establish a  High speed rail service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney, have not been implemented, as the various proposals have been deemed economically unviable. The original plans for Canberra included proposals for railed transport within the city, however none eventuated. A railway connecting Canberra to  Jervis Bay was also planned but never constructed.
Canberra is about three hours by road from Sydney on the  Federal Highway (National Highway 23), which connects with the  Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near  Goulburn, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the  Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass. It is a two hour drive on the  Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the  Snowy Mountains and the  Kosciuszko National Park.  Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the  Kings Highway.
 Canberra International Airport provides direct domestic services to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, with connections to other domestic centres. There are direct daily flights to  Albury and  Newcastle in New South Wales. No regular commercial international flights operate from the airport. Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with  RAAF Base Fairbairn. In June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control. The Air Force still retains a presence at  Fairbairn, which is a leased area in the North East precinct of the airport. The only active unit is  No 34 Squadron, which is responsible for the operations of the airforce's  VIP transport aircraft which are used to transport Australian officials such as the  Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, the  Governor General, the leader of the opposition and high ranking defence force officers when travelling both internationally or within Australia. The Fairbairn area is also used by official aircraft carrying foreign heads of state or government when visiting Canberra.
The government-owned  ACTEW Corporation manages Canberra's water and sewerage infrastructure.  ActewAGL is a joint venture between ACTEW and  AGL, and is the retail provider of Canberra's utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary  TransACT.
Canberra's water is stored in four reservoirs, the Corin, Bendora and Cotter dams on the  Cotter River and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River. Although the Googong Dam is located in New South Wales, it is managed by the ACT government. ACTEW Corporation owns Canberra's two wastewater treatment plants, located at  Fyshwick and on the lower reaches of the  Molonglo River.
Electricity for Canberra comes from the national power grid through substations at  Holt and  Fyshwick (via  Queanbeyan). Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at  Belconnen and Mugga Lane. Power was first supplied from a plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River. The ACT has the highest rate of computer use and internet connection in Australia.

Arthur Edward Jeune &quot;James&quot; Collins (18 August 1885 – 11 November 1914), typically now known by his initials A. E. J. Collins, was an English cricketer and  soldier. He is most famous for achieving the highest-ever recorded score in cricket: as a 13-year-old schoolboy, he scored 628 not out over four afternoons in June 1899. Collins' record-making  innings drew a large crowd and increasing media interest; spectators at the  Old Cliftonian match being played nearby were drawn away to watch the junior school  house cricket match in which Collins was playing. Despite this achievement, Collins never played  first-class cricket.
Collins joined the  British Army in 1902 and studied at the  Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, before becoming an  officer in the  Royal Engineers. He served in France during World War I, where he was  killed in action in 1914 during the  First Battle of Ypres. Collins had been mentioned in dispatches and also represented the Royal Military Academy at cricket and rugby union.
Collins was born in  Hazaribagh, India, to Arthur Herbert Collins, a judge in the  Indian Civil Service, and Mrs Esther Ida Collins. Both of his parents had died by the time he began his education at  Clifton College, Bristol, where he held a scholarship.
He joined Clifton College in September 1897, becoming a member of Clark's  House, although he later moved to North Town House. Clifton had an excellent reputation for sport.  W.G. Grace scored 13 first-class centuries on the Close, and he sent his sons to the school. Collins played half-back for the rugby XV, and was also in the cricket XI. He won a  bronze medal for  boxing at the  public schools tournament in  Aldershot in 1901, along with E. A. Hughes and H. P. Hewett.
Tim Rice, in a 9 June 1999 article for  The Telegraph to celebrate the centenary of the score, entitled &quot;On the seventh day AEJ Collins rested&quot;, described him thus:
In 1899, as a 13-year-old schoolboy, Collins scored the highest ever recorded cricket score of 628 not out. This feat took place during a junior school house cricket match between Clarke's House and North Town House. Such matches were timeless, played to a finish however long they took. The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, now named Collins' Piece. The ground had both a poor surface and a very unusual shape: it was very short (only 60 yards (55 m) long), with a wall only 70 yards (60 m) away forming the  boundary on one side, while the other side was a gentle slope falling away towards the school  sanatorium in the distance. The pitch occupied the central 22 yards (20 m) of the narrow field, with the boundary only 17 yards (16 m) behind each set of stumps. Hits to the long boundary, down the slope, had to be all-run, but the three short boundaries only counted for two runs.
The match commenced on Thursday, 22 June, to take advantage of two half-day holidays while the college team played their annual match against Old Cliftonians nearby. Collins, a right-handed  batsman, won the toss for Clarke's House and chose to bat first. Collins hit his first stroke at around 3.30 pm By the close of play at 6 pm, he had scored 200 runs, having been dropped on 50, 100 and 140.
School lessons allowed another two-and-a-half hours' play on Friday, 23 June, and by then news of an exceptional innings had gone round the school. So brilliant was his play that even the crowd watching an Old Cliftonian match being played nearby lost its interest and a large crowd watched Collins' phenomenal performance. Collins' innings almost ended at 400 when an easy  catch was dropped by the youngest player on the field, 11-year old Victor Fuller-Eberle, but at around 5.30 pm, after batting for around five hours, rapturous applause broke out when he passed  Andrew Stoddart's world-record score of 485. At the end of the second day, he remained unbeaten on 509 and the team on 680 for 8. His innings was reported as a world record in  The Times newspaper on Saturday 24 June; the paper, however, gave Collins's score by the close of play on Friday as 501, his age as 14 and mis-reported his name as &quot;A. E. G. Collins&quot;.
The match resumed in the lunch hour on Monday, 26 June, at 12:30 pm, with a large crowd. By the end of play, Collins had been dropped again, on 556, to reach 598, but another wicket had fallen, and Collins was running out of partners. On Tuesday, 27 June, the school authorities extended the hours available for play in an attempt to finish the match. The crowds grew and media interest escalated, as The Times again reported on the match on Tuesday, and the disruption to school life was considerable. Collins hit out, with his approach being described as &quot;downright reckless&quot;. He was dropped twice more, on 605 and 619. After just 25 minutes' play, Collins lost his final partner, Thomas Redfern, caught by Victor Fuller-Eberle at  point for 13, with Collins' score on 628. Collins had played less than seven hours' cricket,  carrying his bat through his side's innings. He had scored 1 six, 4 fives, 31 fours, 33 threes, 146 twos and 87 singles. The Times once again ran a report, giving the final figures for Collins' innings in its Wednesday 28 June edition—once again, however, they misspelled his third initial.
North Town House, demoralised, were bowled out for 87 in 90 minutes on Tuesday. The match resumed on Wednesday 28 June, when North Town's second innings went even worse, making 61 in just over an hour, so Clarke House won by an innings and 688 runs. Collins showed some ability as an  all-rounder, with his right-arm medium pace  bowling taking 11  wickets for 63  runs.
The scorebook hangs in the pavilion at Clifton to this day. The scorers faced a difficult task in accurately recording the innings. One of them, Edward Peglar, is said to have remarked that Collins's score was &quot;628, plus or minus twenty shall we say&quot;. The other scorer for the match was J.W. Hall, whose father in 1868 had batted with  Edward Tylecote, who later played  Test cricket for England and whose name is on a poem kept with the Ashes urn. Tylecote had earlier set a world-record score of 404 not out in 1868, also at Clifton. Hall later wrote that &quot;The bowling probably deserved all the lordly contempt with which Collins treated it, sending a considerable number of pulls full pitch over the fives courts into the swimming baths to the danger of the occupants.&quot;
Collins became public property for a long while after the match, forever associated with his great score. &quot;Today all men speak of him,&quot; wrote one newspaper, &quot;… he has a reputation as great as the most advertised soap: he will be immortalised.&quot; After leaving school, he never wanted to be reminded of his famous innings; nevertheless, he has been remembered well beyond his own lifetime.
Within two years, 31-year-old Australian Test cricketer  Charles Eady came close to breaking the record, when he made 566 for Break-o'-Day against Wellington in  Hobart in less than eight hours spread over three weeks in March 1902. This remains the closest challenge to Collins' record: only four other players, Dadabhoy Havewala (515), JC Sharp (505 not out), Malhotra Chamanlal (502 not out), and  Brian Lara (501 not out) have ever scored more than 500 runs in one innings in any form of cricket; Lara is the only person to have achieved a score of over 500 runs in  first-class cricket.
Collins chose to follow an army career, passing his entrance exams to the  Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in September 1901 and representing the Royal Military Academy at both football and rugby as well as cricket, scoring a century in a match against  Sandhurst. He joined the  British Army the following year, being commissioned as a  Second Lieutenant in the  Royal Engineers on 21 December 1904. Despite the limitations on his sport that the military service caused, he played several matches for Old Cliftonians, his regiment, and the Army, remaining a free-hitting batsman. He played at  Lord's in 1913 for Royal Engineers against  Royal Artillery, scoring 58 and 36 runs in the two innings, but he never played  first-class cricket. He also joined  Clifton Rugby Football Club in February 1905, but never rose above the 2nd XV. He served with the 2nd Sappers and Miners in India, and was promoted to  Lieutenant on 23 June 1907.
He married Ethel Slater in the spring of 1914, and was sent to France when World War I broke out later that year. He was killed in action, as a  Captain, on 11 November 1914 at the  First Battle of Ypres, while serving with the 5th Field Company, Royal Engineers, at the age of 29. He was signalling for more men to protect the flank of his trench when he was killed; his body was dragged back into the trench by Sapper Farnfield (23900). The 5th Field Company carried out the burials of its Company on 12 November. Due to the continual fighting over this area for the next four years what remained of his grave and remains were never found, but his name is recorded at the  Menin Gate Memorial in Belgium. Before his death, he had been  Mentioned in Despatches. His younger brother Herbert (a Lieutenant in the 24th Battalion of the  Manchester Regiment and also an old Cliftonian) was killed in action on 11 February 1917, aged 27. Collins's wife, Ethel, lived as a widow for over fifty years, dying on 1 September 1966 in  Haslemere.

Alastair Nathan Cook,  MBE (born 25 December 1984) is the  captain of the English Test and ODI cricket teams. He is a left-handed  opening batsman who plays  county cricket for  Essex. Cook played for Essex's  Academy and made his debut for the first XI in 2003. He played in a variety of England's youth teams from 2000 until his call up to the Test side in 2006.
While touring in the West Indies with the  ECB National Academy, Cook was called up to the England national team in India as a last-minute replacement for  Marcus Trescothick and debuted with a century. Debuting at 21 years of age Cook went on to score 1,000 runs in his maiden year and become the youngest Englishman to reach 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 Test runs, making centuries in his first Test matches against India, Pakistan, the West Indies and  Bangladesh.
Despite this prodigious flurry of runs, Cook came under criticism throughout 2008 for a lack of centuries; he replied in 2009 with two centuries, as well as a score of 95 against Australia to help seal England's first victory against them at  Lord's since 1934. He took seven catches in the series, including the final wicket, to win the  2009 Ashes series. After deputising as Test captain in 2010 and then taking ODI captaincy full-time, Cook went on to play another pivotal role in retaining the  2010-11 Ashes series, breaking records by scoring the second highest number of runs in a Test series by an Englishman, including his maiden first-class double-hundred and two further hundreds, and batting for over 35 hours during the series.
He was appointed as the captain of the Test team after fellow opener  Andrew Strauss's retirement on 29 August 2012. Cook captained England to its first Test series victory on Indian soil since 1984–85. During the tour he broke the record for most Test centuries for England, 23 and became the first captain to score a century in each of his first five Tests in charge.
Cook was appointed  Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the  2011 Birthday Honours.
Born in  Gloucester, Alastair Cook is one of several players of mixed Anglo-Welsh heritage to play for England; his mother Stephanie is a teacher from  Swansea, while his father Graham worked as a  BT engineer as well as being a village cricketer. Cook is a keen musician. By the age of eight, he was learning the clarinet, and joined  St Paul's Cathedral School in London, an  independent school connected to the cathedral, as a  chorister, where he boarded under a rigorous schedule of rehearsals, whilst also learning the clarinet.
Cook later claimed the amount of focus and concentration required to keep practising while undergoing regular school hours helped with his batting. During his summer holidays, he would play cricket for  Maldon Cricket Club, and by the age of 11 he was already playing for their adult side on the Third XI. He played sporadically for them over seven years, with an average of 168 in his final year at a club of which he is now an honorary life member.
Cook's musical flair led to him being granted a scholarship to  Bedford School, an  independent school in the  county town of  Bedford in  Southern England when he was 13, also as a boarder. While being educated in Bedford, he also learned to play piano and saxophone. However, music was soon eclipsed when the  Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) came to play against the Bedford XI. The visiting side were a man short and drafted the 14-year-old new boy to play against his school; Cook scored a century.
Over the next four years, he hit 17 centuries and two double-hundreds, to total 4,396 runs at an average of 87.90, captaining the cricket team in his final year under coach Jeremy 'Boris' Farrell, as well as being president of the music society. He also gained three  A-Levels and nine  GCSEs in his time there. In his final year at Bedford, in 2003, he scored 1,287 runs for the school, including two unbeaten double-hundreds, averaging 160.87 to take the school record. After his international success, Cook returned for an Old Boys match at Bedford in 2008, playing for the HM Ultimate XI.
Having already been a member of the Essex  Academy since the age of 15, Cook was given his  first-class debut for  Essex County Cricket Club coming straight out of school at the end of the 2003 season against  Nottinghamshire; put in to field he aided the first dismissal with a catch before falling short at 13 runs in his first innings but pushing Essex to a nine wicket victory with 69  not out in the second. Despite relegation being assured to Essex, Cook still battled away with an opening stand of 122 opposite  Will Jefferson in the second innings of his second match, against  Warwickshire. In the six innings he participated in, he quickly racked up three half centuries at an average of 47.80. Having secured his place as opener in the county team, he made his maiden first-class  century against  Leicestershire in May 2004 with 126 opposite Jefferson's 128 for a 265 opening stand, Essex's third highest but failed to secure promotion for the team.
His exploits in his single season gained him enough attention to be brought in as the opening batsman for the MCC in 2005 season's opener against County Champions  Warwickshire. With a century in the first innings and a near attempt at 97 in the second, Cook helped secure victory in a match destined for a draw. The season opener would not be Cook's only highlight for the year, as the  Ashes approached Australia were touring the counties and in a two-day match which sadly did not count towards his first-class statistics, Cook scored a double century went on to take the first wicket of  Justin Langer with a catch in the drawn match days after being awarded  PCA Young Cricketer of the Year. A further highlight of the season saw Cook help Essex to score one of  Durham's two defeats of the season, scoring 107 of Essex's 245 before taking his maiden first-class wicket, before taking another two, with his off-spin. Cook played in every first-class match for Essex and also helped them clinch the  Totesport League Title for the first time in 20 years. The end of the season saw Cook finish with an average of 48.03 in the County Championship, hitting four centuries.
After his England call up, Cook's appearances at Essex significantly reduced. In the County Championship he appeared in only three matches, making two hundreds and another two fifties in his five innings, topping the season averages with an inflated 141.3. Similarly in the  Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy he appeared only three times and again topped the batting averages, only being out once with a top score of 91 and average of 148. He scored less favourably in his one  Twenty20 Cup appearance, scoring only nine runs. In the 2007 season, for Essex alone his first-class average was only 58.8 from three appearances, making two hundreds but countering this with one  duck and he made a similar century/duck appearance in the (formerly C&amp;G) Friends Provident Trophy during his 5 matches averaging 38.4. The back to back Totesport/Pro40 champions saw Cook make only one appearance in that competition, scoring 81  not out, before being relegated. They won Division Two and were promoted the following season, though Cook only provided 11 runs in one innings during the tournament. Despite his international commitments Cook managed to participate in at least one match of each tournament averaging only 36.16 in three County Championship matches and a disappointing 15 in his one Twenty20 match. Given time off the South Africa One-Day series, Cook favoured better in the FP Trophy with 45.3 from 3 matches including contributing the second highest in the final at  Lord's to seal the trophy.
The 2009 English season featured an early Test series against the West Indies where, despite being in the Test team, Cook joined Essex in a tour match. He scored 76 not out in the second innings before the match was rained off, stopping Essex pressing for victory. Before the Test series he helped Essex force the follow on against Kent in the County Championship but faltered with his team, scoring only 4 in the second innings to lose by 192 runs. After the Test series, Cook was omitted from the one day side leaving him free to play for Essex. He joined them in their bid to defend their Friends Provident Trophy matching  Varun Chopra's 65 in a 124 run partnership against Lancashire to gain a place in the semi-final. He and his team could not recreate that magic for the semi-final, at the same location against the same team three days later, after being caught from a fine running catch by  Sajid Mahmood, seeing the team lose by 67 runs. Having been knocked out of the FP Trophy, the team turned to the  Twenty20 Cup. Making only his fourth appearance in the tournament since 2005, Cook smashed 80 off 56 balls in a vain effort against Kent that was rained off. While his England partner Bopara shone against Sussex, Cook only scored one but made up for this with a 60 run partnership with Bopara days later to put Essex top of the table. Despite averaging 49 from these four games, Cook felt he was a long way from the international squad. In his last performance before joining with the Ashes squad, Cook scored a 57 ball century, carrying his bat through the innings as they crushed Surrey but without Cook and Bopara, the team were knocked out after two successive losses.
Cook had his first taste of international cricket playing the U15 World Cup in 2000. Three years later Cook was called up to the  Under 19 England team for their tour of South Africa. After it was decided  Samit Patel had enough responsibility batting and bowling, Cook was appointed captain of the team the following year, 2004. His first call of duty was the U19 World Cup in the  West Indies where he guided England through the group stages and on past the Super League stage, including an unbeaten century-each partnership with Patel against New Zealand, and continued a 100% win record with 87 over eventual winners Pakistan before falling short in the semi-final against the West Indies. He went on from there to captain them in a U19 Test win over Bangladesh before taking the One-Day series too. His career with the Under 19 team was cut short when  Kevin Pietersen was called up to replace Andrew Flintoff in the main team, leaving a spot in  England A's tour of Sri Lanka for Cook. After the 2005 domestic season he was part of the intake for the  ECB National Academy, but this was interrupted as he flew to Pakistan to cover the squad for  Michael Vaughan's knee injury. After not being used in the first XI he travelled back with the Academy to the West Indies in the new year scoring 101 in a two-day match against Antigua before youth cricket came to an abrupt halt for Cook.
Cook was included in the ECB National Academy in the winter of 2005–06. The Academy's  tour of the West Indies was cut short on 24 February for Cook who only appeared in the first innings, scoring only 6, before being called up, alongside  James Anderson and  Owais Shah, to the  England team's tour of India to replace captain  Michael Vaughan who was suffering from a knee injury and opener  Marcus Trescothick who was suffering from stress. Unlike Shah and Anderson, Cook was welcomed straight into the England XI and made his Test debut aged 21, days after he had flown in from the West Indies. He made an instant impact, opening with  Andrew Strauss and scoring a half century in the first innings before being bowled just before tea on the first day for 60 runs from 160 balls being the second top scorer after 134 from  Paul Collingwood. The second innings would prove to cement him in cricket history as he went on to score 104 not out before England declared, making him the sixteenth Englishman to score a century on his debut Test and an even more exclusive list of five to score 100 and 50 in their first Test. His hundred was also the 3,000th century in Test cricket. Despite being known for a patient style of play, an impending declaration forced Cook to play quickly to bring up the century; regardless, the match was drawn. After a mediocre outing in the losing second Test, scoring 17 and 2, he missed the Third Test due to a stomach illness and was omitted from the one-day series.
Returning home, Cook was again selected for the first XI during  Sri Lanka's tour. For his debut match at Lord's, Cook was shuffled down to third to make way for the returning Trescothick. However, he still walked to the crease alongside his teammate as Strauss fell at the stroke of lunch. Cook and Trescothick put on 127 in their partnership as Trescothick made a century while Cook later stumbled just before at 89; there was no second innings as England forced the  follow-on but were one wicket away from victory with Cook being targeted among others for two significant dropped catches. Cook's first taste of victory came in the second Test, guiding the team past the target of 78 in the second innings with an unbeaten 34 alongside Andrew Flintoff furthering the reputation of his calm, meticulous style of play against the dangerous spin of Muttiah Muralitharan who took 4–29. Although not initially selected for the one-day series, Cook made his limited overs debut in the fourth match scoring 39 from 38 balls in a bright spot of an otherwise dour England performance hampered by injuries.
At the start of the following  series against Pakistan, Cook recorded his second Test century, gaining him a spot on the boards at Lord's alongside  Ian Bell and Collingwood, though he only managed four in the second innings. He and Bell both recorded back to back centuries by the following Test at  Old Trafford as well as Cook scoring his then-career best 127 in an innings defeat over Pakistan. In what now seemed a pattern, Cook's century came up while partnering with Collingwood as with his previous two. In the controversial forfeited Test, sometimes called Ovalgate, Cook contributed a first innings top score of 40 and second best 83 before Pakistan refused to return to the field. This score secured Cook's tally of runs, 403, as the second highest scorer for England and third overall in the series. Once again Cook was overlooked in the one day series. At the end of the season he was again awarded the Young Player of the Year award as well as being shortlisted for ICC Emerging Player of the Year.
As well as the one day series against Pakistan, Cook was overlooked for the  2006 Champions Trophy squad. However, he was named for the  2006–07 Ashes series touring party and when Trescothick pulled out once again due to stress, Cook re-earned a spot as an opener for the foreseeable future. In the disastrous 5 Test whitewash, Cook failed to impress in the first two Tests, but during a two day warm-up he retired with a century and afterwards remained adamant that he and England would make a turn around in the series. With England desperately chasing 577 runs, or a draw to not lose the Ashes, Cook stayed at the crease for over six hours, lasting almost all of the fourth day to earn his maiden Ashes century (119) before being caught behind off  Glenn McGrath just shy of three overs before the close of play. This was his fourth Test century before turning 22, no England player had scored more than two by the same age. With only three other batsmen scoring double figures, England lost the Test and the Ashes and despite only having an average of 27.6 runs, Cook scored one of only three English centuries on the tour and also on 28 December 2006 in Melbourne, Cook scored his thousandth Test run, the second cricketer to do this in their maiden year, after  Mark Taylor.
After being omitted for the  Twenty20 International against Australia and the  2007 World Cup, Cook found himself once again in favour for the  home series against West Indies. Starting at Lord's, Cook found himself among four centurions in the opening innings with Collingwood opposite him once again, being one of only five Englishmen to hit as many centuries in 15 Tests and recorded another half century in the following innings to win his first  Man of The Match award. After another half century in the second Test, Cook recorded another half century/century combination in the two innings at Old Trafford, his first innings sixty equating to the team's win margin. Cook was selected for his first Twenty20 International against the West Indies, in a losing effort where he scored 15 runs from 16 balls. This was followed by a disappointing one-day series for Cook, and England, who averaged 22 in 3 matches.
The following  home series against India saw Cook continue his fine Test form despite England not winning a Test. He was the third highest scoring Englishman with an average of 37. During the first day of the second Test at  Trent Bridge, Cook became the youngest English player to rack up 1,500 Test runs eclipsing the record held by  David Gower. Cook played in six of the seven ensuing one-day matches, scoring his maiden ODI century in the first match alongside Ian Bell's 126 not out guiding England to a 104 win victory that propped up England's first one-day series victory since 2005. After two ducks, Cook was dropped in the final, decisive match.
After being omitted from the  World Twenty20 Cook rejoined  England in Sri Lanka making an outstanding contribution in both forms of the game. Starting with another ODI series victory, Cook battled with a stomach virus to top score 47 in a losing match and went on to be the second highest scoring batsmen in the series behind  Chamara Silva with 155. Cook also picked up his first ODI Man of The Match award in the fourth game. After an unsuccessful first Test, Cook went on to be the top scoring Test batsmen for England too, scoring two half centuries in the second Test and 118 in the third match, at an average of 46. Up until this tour, Cook had held a strange record of having more Test centuries than half centuries but this century marked his last until March 2009 and Cook came under increasing criticism for his lack of ability to convert fifties to hundreds at the top of the order, yet maintained an average in the low forties.
England's tour of the antipodes continued as  England toured New Zealand and Cook made a great start in the warm up matches, making a half century followed by an  unbeaten 138 the following day in limited overs matches. His style was still considered too slow for the following two Twenty20 Internationals and he failed to continue his form in the first ODI where he fell for 11 as part of an England collapse. The second match saw a similar collapse by England where Cook's 52 was the only real contribution until he was run out by fellow Essexian  Ravi Bopara. The fourth one day match saw Cook and  Phil Mustard prop up the innings with an opening stand of 158 before both being dismissed in successive balls, leading to a tied match. Although normally known for his slow but focussed repose with the bat, the first Test against New Zealand gave Cook a chance making three sharp catches in the first innings and mirroring his efforts with three even more spectacular catches in the second innings, the first two off  Ryan Sidebottom who then went on to make a  hat-trick with a final  LBW, the match itself saw England collapse in the second innings for 110 with Cook being the only other player besides  Ian Bell to make it into double figures. Incidentally, Cook's other catch in the second innings was also off Sidebottom to dismiss New Zealand captain  Daniel Vettori, a feat the pair reproduced in the second innings of the second Test and again in the first innings of the third Test. His batting meanwhile began its long road of decline scoring no more than sixty in the two Tests and falling for only two runs in the final match, though in the second Test he did secure another English record being the youngest Englishman at just over 23 years, to score 2,000 Test runs – again eclipsing Gower; two days later he recorded his first Test six after 2047 runs, including 233 boundaries, after an accidental top edge and ruined his chances of beating  Vijay Manjrekar's 2,308 record.
Back  home in England Cook failed to reproduce his legacy of Lord's centuries. Scoring 61 in the only England innings of the first Test which was his only score over fifty from the four innings in England's successful series. His poor form in the long format led to him being omitted for the Twenty20 series and all but the final one-day match.
With a year to go before the  2009 Ashes it was imperative for Cook to cement his position as opener in the  home series against South Africa. Again, at Lord's, Cook made his way comfortably to a half-century before being dismissed for 60. A high team score, together with a benevolent wicket, saw the fifth day bring Cook's first Test over as a bowler: he conceded just one run. Cook fell in one innings of each Test between fifty and a hundred, amassing the considerable average of 47 for the series.
Once again Cook found himself omitted from the Twenty20 and one-day team both for the home series against South Africa as well as the majority of the  away series in India, where a string of poor England performances saw him called up for the fifth and ultimately the final match after the  terrorist attacks in Mumbai. When the Tests arrived, Cook continued to notch a half-century in one innings of each match, but was outshone by opening partner Strauss's centuries.
After India, England went to  the West Indies under the new captaincy of Andrew Strauss after Pietersen's brief tenure  ended in controversy. Cook was shown still to have the selectors' confidence despite his lack of centuries when he was given the unofficial vice-captaincy before the tour began. The title gave him a boost: he went on to score two fifties in the first warm-up match, retiring out in the second innings but contrasted that with a duck in the next tour match. Similarly, in the First Test he scored four and another duck. After the third Test was abandoned due to the poor quality of the surface, Cook was again beleaguered by his perennial problem: he scored two half centuries against opening partner Strauss's 169. He seemed to have put it behind him in the first innings of the next Test, however, as he and Strauss put on a record opening stand of 229. Strauss was bowled first for 169 as Cook reached the nineties but fell shortly thereafter for 94. After two days' batting on a benign pitch, the West Indies declared on 749 for nine in response to England's 600 for six. Put back in with one day to spare, Strauss fell for 33, but, after 38 innings' and fifteen months' waiting, Cook finally arrived at his eighth Test century, and went on to pass his highest score with an unbeaten 139 before play ended in a draw. During this innings, Cook also became the youngest Englishman to pass 3,000 Test runs.
England returned home, only to  face the West Indies once more. The Second Test took the sides to the  Riverside in Durham where, on a benign surface, Cook battled through the first day. After Strauss fell in the morning session, Cook began a partnership with Ravi Bopara, who had recently been promoted to third in the batting order. Over the first day, the two navigated a slow partnership, both strike rates remaining under 55, but, once Cook reached his ninth Test century, Bopara matched it with his own, culminating in a 213-run partnership at Bopara's fall in the closing overs of the day; Cook ended unbeaten on 126. After the second day of play was completely washed out, Cook recorded his first Test 150 and subsequently his then highest score of 160.
Omitted from the  World Twenty20 competition, Cook returned to Essex for two moderate county matches but impressive Twenty20 games. Despite being the only Englishman to score a century, or even more than 50, in the first innings of England's warm up match against  Warwickshire, in the first Ashes Test at Cardiff, Cook was the lowest scoring recognised batsman, scoring 10 and 6 – caught in the gully in the first innings, and trapped LBW by  Mitchell Johnson in the second. Cook bounced back in the second Test at Lord's, batting through to the afternoon session, as he and his captain  Andrew Strauss (who scored 161) set the record for the highest opening English partnership at Lord's with 196, Cook initially scored faster than Strauss but fell short of another Lord's century, trapped again by Johnson for 95. This partnership, along with Strauss' anchoring throughout the innings, led England to a total of 425 and enabled them to gain a 210-run first-innings lead, aided by three catches from Cook off James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Batting quickly in the second innings to force victory, Cook scored 32 from 54 balls before again falling LBW but providing enough for England to cement their first victory over Australia at  Lord's since 1934 and second since 1896.
After this high, the series took a severe downturn for Cook as his only appearance in the third Test was a duck. With no second innings to redeem himself, pressure began to mount on Cook for the fourth Test at  Headingley Stadium where he anchored himself through half the team before being dismissed half-way through the first innings for only 30, a score which would only be topped by wicket-keeper  Matt Prior as England collapsed to Australia's seam attack, bowled out for 102. Though the team batted better in the second innings Cook again was the fifth man out for another 30 as England succumbed to an innings defeat, with Australia levelling the series needing only to draw at  the Oval to retain the Ashes. During the fortnight break Cook was among a quintet of players released into the County Championship to increase their form alongside. In the first-class match against Middlesex both he and Bopara failed in the first innings, with scores of 4 and 1, but Cook top scored in the second innings with 64 to push Essex towards victory. Of the five released, Cook was among three picked for the final and decisive Oval Test and didn't start well being dismissed with only 12 runs on the board, ten of them his. However, in the field Cook was part of Australia's first innings collapse, taking two catches off  Graeme Swann to dismiss the top scoring opener  Simon Katich and the penultimate wicket of  Stuart Clark. Working with a 172 run lead on the second evening, Strauss and Cook's steady partnership was ended prematurely with Cook dismissed for 9 in his final innings of the series. Despite this Cook ended the series on something of a high in his fielding position at short leg, taking a catch off  Steve Harmison's second wicket in two balls for the penultimate wicket and then taking the winning catch of a leading edge from the defiant  Michael Hussey for 121 off Swann to seal the Ashes victory.
Cook made his return to international Twenty20 cricket during the tour of South Africa in 2009–10. After scoring 11 runs in the first match, Cook was handed the captaincy after Paul Collingwood picked up an injury prior to the second match but led them to an 84 run loss after posting only 26. In the second Test he scored a patient 118 after being saved by a third umpire referral at 64. This, along with a century from Ian Bell, gave England their only Test win of the drawn series with an innings margin. Despite a meagre performance in the rest of the series, it was quickly announced that England's 2010 tour against  Bangladesh would see Strauss rested, with Cook taking on the captaincy role in the Test and One-Day teams as, what national selector  Geoff Miller, &quot;an audition for future engagements&quot;.
In his first Test as captain in Chittagong, Cook led the team to a win, despite a strong rearguard from Bangladesh, with the top score in both innings. Scoring a century in the first, in the second innings he accumulated 4,000 Test which coincided with teammate Collingwood achieving the same. At 25 years, 79 days Cook became the youngest Englishman to reach this amount and the second youngest worldwide after Indian veteran Sachin Tendulkar who was 24 years, 224 days old. In the second Test, Cook scored the winning runs in a nine wicket win, having scored another century. By virtue of being captain, Cook returned to England's ODI squad for the first time since 2008 and led the team as an opening batsmen to a three win whitewash with respectable scores.
After England's successful tour of Bangladesh, Bangladesh came to  tour England with Strauss returning as captain and Cook being omitted once more for the short format. Later in the Summer  Pakistan toured England also. It took until the fifth Test of the summer for Cook to pass 50, scoring 110 in a losing cause against Pakistan. Before then, he had come in for much scrutiny, especially regarding his technique outside off-stump, and many considered his place to be under-threat. His timely century secured his place for the last Test, although he only scored 10 in an innings win by England, further putting his place into question heading into the  Winter tour of Australia.
Although there were still concerns about Cook's form and technique ahead of the  2010-11 Ashes series, Cook answered his critics in the best way possible. Following a century in one of the warm-up games, Cook opened his series account with 67 as England won the toss and batted at  The Gabba in Brisbane. After surrendering a first-innings deficit of 221, Cook fought back with fellow-opener Strauss and  Jonathan Trott. Strauss scored 110 as England scored 188 for the first wicket. With this partnership, Cook and Strauss became England's highest scoring opening partners across their four years together, beating an eighty year-old record set by  Jack Hobbs and  Herbert Sutcliffe; albeit taking 44 more innings to do so. Cook was joined by Trott and they scored an unbeaten partnership of 329; Cook recorded his first double-century in first class cricket, finishing on 235 not out, and Trott scored 135 not out before England declared on 517–1. Cook's 235* overtook Donald Bradman's record score at the ground and several other records were set in that innings.
In the second Test at Adelaide, Cook scored another century, his 15th, which saw him match Bradman in scoring 15 centuries before his 26th birthday (they are joint-second behind Sachin Tendulkar). Cook broke  Wally Hammond's record of runs scored without being out and  Nasser Hussain's record of most minutes at the crease without being out, before being caught behind off an inside edge for 148 after over 1,000 minutes of being at the crease.
Cook, along with his teammates in a losing effort, performed poorly in the third Test but contributed to an innings victory in the fourth, becoming the series' leading run scorer after scoring 82. In the fifth and final Test, Cook twice survived being given out by debutant  Michael Beer, the first from a no ball and the second (at 99 runs) after the third umpire confirmed the onfield decision that the ball had not carried. Eventually caught by  Michael Hussey, his score of 189 saw him reach 5,000 Test runs in his career while in the series alone he amounted over 36 hours at the crease, a world record in a five Test series and an English record even including six Test series, as well as scoring 766 runs to become England's second highest series scorer behind 906 by Wally Hammond 80 years previous. At the end of the final Test, Cook was presented with both the Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards.
Following England's quarter-final departure from the  2011 World Cup, Andrew Strauss resigned the ODI captaincy and Cook was named his successor, despite not having featured in an ODI since leading the side in Bangladesh. In addition to Cook's promotion, seam bowler  Stuart Broad was named captain of the Twenty20 side and England went into the  home series with Sri Lanka with different captains for each format of the game.
Cook's first game as full-time Captain against Sri Lanka at the Oval saw England victorious by 110 runs. England went on to win the series 3–2, with Cook top scoring for England in the series with 298 runs in five matches. This performance also led to an ODI player of the series award.
On 29 August 2012, Cook became England's Test captain after previous Test captain  Andrew Strauss retired from all forms of cricket. Cook, who captained England in Bangladesh for two Tests in a previous series, took charge of England for the Test series against India in the winter of 2012. In each of the first three Tests – the first a defeat and the second a ten-wicket victory – he scored a century. This, together with a century in each of the aforementioned two Tests in Bangladesh, gave Cook five centuries in five Tests as captain, a record number. His scores on the tour also included 119 and 97 in the warm-up matches. The ten-wicket victory in the second Test was lauded by the media as one of England's greatest victories, and Cook's run of hundreds brought him level with the English Test record for most centuries. On 6 December 2012, Cook became England's leading scorer of centuries after making a hundred against India in Kolkata.
On 7 December 2012 he captained England to its first test series victory on Indian soil since 1984–85, as well as overtaking Mike Gatting as England's highest ever run scorer in India 
As well as his successful career in the realms of cricket, Cook also uses his talents in other fields. As well as being a columnist in  The Daily Telegraph and  Metro, he used his erstwhile musical flair with the saxophone to contribute to  Freefonix, a CBBC animated series with music-based adventures. As well as this, Cook has donated his time to various charities including taking part in The Great City Race for  Breakthrough Breast Cancer and modelled nude alongside fellow cricketers  James Anderson and  Stuart Broad to help raise awareness for testicular cancer on behalf of the  Everyman Campaign. On 31 December 2011 Cook married his childhood sweetheart, Alice Hunt.

Alberto Contador Velasco (Spanish pronunciation:  [alˈβerto kontaˈðor βeˈlasko]; born 6 December 1982) is a Spanish professional cyclist, one of five riders to have won all three  Grand Tours of road cycling. He was the winner of the  2007 Tour de France with the  Discovery Channel team. With the Astana team he has won the  2008 Giro d'Italia, the  2008 Vuelta a España and the  2009 Tour de France. He initially also won the  2010 Tour de France with this team, and the  2011 Giro d'Italia with team Saxo Bank-SunGard, only to be stripped of these titles later having been found guilty of a doping offence. Following his return from a suspension, he won the  2012 Vuelta a España.
Contador has been widely considered to be the best  climbing specialist and stage racer in the world. Notable summit stage finishes on which he has victories include the  Alto de El Angliru in the Vuelta, the  Plateau de Beille in the Tour and  Mount Etna in the Giro. After being widely expected to lose his tenuous lead in the 2007 Tour de France in that race's final  individual time trial, Contador has become a more accomplished time trialist, with several victories in the discipline. He has earned a reputation as an all-rounder, a cyclist who excels in all aspects of stage racing which are needed for high places in the  general classification.
Contador's career has been marked by doping allegations. The  Operación Puerto doping case led his  Astana-Würth team (a team unrelated to the current Astana team) to withdraw en masse from the  2006 Tour de France before it began. He was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, but was also accused of doping after his victory in the race the following year. In September 2010, Contador announced that he had tested positive for  clenbuterol in a control taken during that year's Tour de France, in which he finished as winner, but although he was suspended during an investigation, he was cleared by the  RFEC. A review by the  Court of Arbitration for Sport initially set for June 2011 was later deferred several times until February 2012, when the CAS decided that Contador be stripped from the results obtained in the 2010 Tour de France and later, which also caused him to lose his 2011 Giro d'Italia victory. He was also suspended until 5 August 2012, and his contract with  Team Saxo Bank was annulled. Upon the completion of his ban, Contador rejoined the renamed Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank.
Contador was born in  Pinto in the  Community of Madrid, the third of four children. He has an older brother and sister and a younger brother, who has  cerebral palsy. Having previously practised other sports, such as football and athletics, Contador discovered cycling at the age of 14 thanks to his elder brother Francisco Javier.
When Contador was 15, he began to compete in races at the amateur level in Spain, joining the Real Velo Club Portillo from Madrid. Although he got no victories that year or the next, he demonstrated great qualities and was soon nicknamed Pantani (after  Marco Pantani, regarded as one of the best climbers of all time) for his climbing skills. In 2000, he experienced his first victories, winning several mountains classification prizes from prominent events on the Spanish amateur cycling calendar.
He dropped out of school at the age of 16 without having finished his  Bachillerato and signed with Iberdrola-Loinaz, a youth team run by  Manolo Saiz, manager of the professional  ONCE cycling team. In 2001, he won the under-23 Spanish time trial championship.
Contador lives with his wife Macarena in the city of Pinto when not competing, and enjoys hunting in his spare time. He has a fascination for birds, keeping personally bred canaries and goldfinches at home.
Contador turned professional in 2003 for  ONCE-Eroski. In his first year as a professional he won the eighth stage of the  Tour de Pologne, an individual time trial. During the first stage of the 2004  Vuelta a Asturias he started to feel unwell, and after 40 kilometers he fell and went into convulsions. He had been suffering from headaches for several days beforehand and was diagnosed with a cerebral  cavernoma, a congenital vascular disorder, for which he underwent risky surgery and a recovery to get back on his bike. As a result of the surgery, he has a scar that runs from one ear to the other over the top of his head. Contador started to train again at the end of 2004 and eight months after the surgery he won the fifth stage of the 2005  Tour Down Under racing for Liberty Seguros, as the team previously known as ONCE had become. He went on to win the third stage and the overall classification of the  Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, thus winning his first  stage race as a professional. He also won an individual time trial during the  Tour of the Basque Country, where he finished third, and the fourth stage of the  Tour de Romandie, where he finished fourth overall.
In 2006, he won stages at the  Tour de Romandie and  Tour de Suisse in preparation for the  Tour de France. Prior to the start of the race he was implicated along with several teammates in the  Operación Puerto doping case by the Spanish authorities, and the team was not able to start. He was later cleared by the  Union Cycliste Internationale, cycling's  governing body. Contador returned to racing in the  Vuelta a Burgos but he crashed after finishing fifth in stage 4, when he was riding back down to the team bus, and briefly lost consciousness.
After having been implicated in the  Operación Puerto doping case, Contador was without a professional contract until mid-January 2007, when he signed with  Discovery Channel.
Contador's first major professional victory came with the  2007 Paris–Nice, which he won on the race's final stage. Discovery effectively wore down the remnants of the race leader  Davide Rebellin's  Gerolsteiner team, allowing Contador to launch an attack on the final climb. With Rebellin leading the chase, Contador held off his competitors in the final kilometers, winning him the race.
In the  2007 Tour de France, he won a stage at the mountaintop finish of  Plateau-de-Beille, and was second in the  general classification to  Michael Rasmussen. Upon Rasmussen's removal from the race before stage 17 for lying to his team about his pre-race training whereabouts, Contador assumed the overall lead and the yellow jersey, though he did not don it until after the stage. In the stage 19 individual time trial, he managed to defy expectations and keep hold of the yellow jersey by a margin of only 23 seconds over challenger  Cadel Evans and 31 seconds over teammate  Levi Leipheimer. As this was the Tour's penultimate stage, it was the last real competition of the race (since the final stage is traditionally non-competitive save for a bunched sprint to the finish line) and it secured Contador his first Tour de France victory. It is the closest the top three finishers in the Tour de France have ever finished to one another.
After Discovery Channel announced 2007 would be its final season in professional cycling, Contador announced on 23 October 2007 that he would move to the  Astana team for 2008.
On 13 February 2008, the organizer of the Tour de France, the  Amaury Sport Organisation, announced that Astana would not be invited to any of their events in 2008 due to the doping previously perpetrated by Astana, despite the fact that its management and most of its ridership had changed before the 2008 season. Consequently, Contador was unable to defend his  2007 Paris–Nice and  2007 Tour de France victories. He went on to win his second  Vuelta a Castilla y León, as well as the  Tour of the Basque Country by winning the opening stage and the final individual time trial. His next scheduled race and objective was the  Dauphiné Libéré but his team received an invite to the  2008 Giro d'Italia one week prior to the start of the race. Contador was on a beach in Spain when he was told he was going to ride the Giro. Despite the lack of preparation, he finished second in the first individual time trial and took the  pink jersey after the 15th stage up to Passo Fedaia. Upon winning the final pink jersey in Milan, he became the first non-Italian to win the Giro d'Italia since  Pavel Tonkov in  1996 and also the second Spanish rider to win the Giro after  Miguel Indurain won in  1992 and  1993. He later emphasized the importance of this win by saying that &quot;taking part in the Giro and winning it was a really big achievement, bigger than if I'd had a second victory in the Tour de France&quot;.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Contador competed in the  road race and the  individual road time trial. He did not finish in the road race, in which 53 of the 143 starters did not complete the course in particularly hot and humid conditions. He placed fourth in the individual time trial, eight seconds behind his regular teammate Leipheimer.
Contador entered the  2008 Vuelta a España as the main candidate to win. His biggest challenger was likely to be compatriot  Carlos Sastre, who had won the  Tour de France just a month before. Contador won stage 13 by attacking on the fabled  Angliru climb and this resulted in him capturing the  golden jersey as the leader of the race. He extended his lead by winning stage 14 to Fuentes de Invierno and maintained his lead in subsequent flat stages and the final time trial. That final time trial was won by Leipheimer by a wide margin. Contador later took some offense to Leipheimer seemingly riding with winning the Vuelta in mind, after it had been established earlier in the race that Contador was Astana's team leader. In the final standings, Contador finished 46 seconds ahead of Leipheimer and more than four minutes ahead of Sastre. The win made him the fifth cyclist to win all three Grand Tours, after  Jacques Anquetil,  Felice Gimondi,  Eddy Merckx, and Bernard Hinault. In the process he also became the first Spaniard, youngest (age 25), and shortest amount of time to accumulate all three wins (15 months). He also became only the third cyclist to win the Giro and the Vuelta in the same year, joining Merckx (who did it in 1973) and  Giovanni Battaglin (who did it in 1981).
Later in the year, Contador won the  Vélo d'Or award for the best rider of the year for the second consecutive season. The Giro and Vuelta winner beat Olympic time-trial champion  Fabian Cancellara and Tour winner  Carlos Sastre in a vote by international cycling writers.
On 9 September 2008, the seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong announced that he was returning to professional cycling with the express goal of participating in the  2009 Tour de France.  Astana manager  Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong's former mentor and  sporting director, said that he could not allow Armstrong riding for another team and later signed him. The announcement by Armstrong clashed with the ambitions of Contador, who insisted he deserved the leadership of Astana, and hinted at the possibility of leaving the team if he was given a secondary role supporting Armstrong. Contador was later given assurances by Bruyneel that he would remain team leader and decided to remain at Astana for the 2009 season. Contador later claimed the situation was drastically overblown by the media. Contador decided to miss the  2009 Giro d'Italia to focus on winning the Tour de France.
Contador started his 2009 season at the  Volta ao Algarve race in Portugal, winning the overall classification, placing second on stage 3, and winning the decisive 33 km individual time trial. He was in position to win  Paris–Nice again after winning the prologue and the toughest mountain stage, but suffered a breakdown in stage 7, losing his yellow jersey to fellow Spaniard  Luis Leon Sánchez. Contador and his Astana team later blamed the breakdown on Contador eating inadequately, leaving him without the energy to chase attacks. Contador finished fourth overall. Contador continued his build up to the  Tour by racing the  Dauphiné Libéré. He put in a strong performance of the opening time trial and stayed in touch with race leader  Cadel Evans on the longer time trial. However, the strong ride of compatriot  Alejandro Valverde up the  Ventoux distanced Contador and he rode to help Valverde take the Yellow Jersey while finishing comfortably in third place overall.
On 26 June 2009, Contador competed in the Time Trial of the Spanish National Championships. He stated that he entered the race in order to gain more experience on his new Trek TT bike, but he came away with a convincing victory over Luis León Sánchez, the defending champion, winning by 37 seconds. This is his first National Championship as a professional.
Contador won Stage 15 of the  2009 Tour de France by soloing to the finish line more than a minute ahead of most of his closest GC competitors, and in so doing took the  general classification leader's yellow jersey. He then extended his lead on Stage 17, after finishing second in a breakaway of three riders with the same time as the stage winner, and then the next day he won the second time trial, increasing his overall advantage to more than four minutes.
Contador won his second Tour de France on 26 July 2009 with a winning margin of 4'11&quot; over  Andy Schleck. He finished 5'24&quot; ahead of Lance Armstrong, who finished third in his return to the Tour after a four-year absence. Contador has won the last four  Grand Tour races that he has entered. During the celebration at the podium, the organizers of the Tour wrongly played the  Danish National Anthem instead of the  Spanish Royal March. In the aftermath of the tour, Contador and Armstrong engaged in a war of words, with Contador quoted as saying that, although Armstrong &quot;is a great rider and [..] did a great Tour[, but] on a personal level [..] I have never admired him and never will&quot;, and Armstrong responding that &quot;a champion is also measured on how much he respects his teammates and opponents.&quot; The sniping caused others, such as the director of the Tour, to wonder &quot;what it would have been like to have had Contador and Armstrong in different teams.&quot;
On 31 July, Contador's agent (who is also his brother) announced that Contador had turned down an offer to remain with Astana under a new four-year contract because he had felt so uncomfortable being caught between the Kazakhstan owners of the team on one side and Bruyneel on the other, and he was hoping to leave Astana at the end of the year, although his contract did not expire until the end of 2010. However, on 11 August, Contador's teammate and close friend  Sérgio Paulinho accepted a two-year contract with  Team RadioShack, indicating that Contador might not be able to leave Astana as readily as he and his agent wished. This was confirmed on 15 August, when a spokesperson for the Kazakhstan sponsors of Astana said that they intended to sponsor the Astana team on the UCI ProTour through 2013 and that they intended to enforce the last year of Contador's contract with Astana in 2010.
On 21 February, Contador won his first race of the season, the  Volta ao Algarve, by winning its queen stage and finishing second in the final time trial. Due to new UCI regulations concerning the nose cone of time trial bikes, Contador did not use his Shiv time trial bike, and instead used the standard red Specialized time trial bike. On 14 March, Contador won his second  Paris–Nice, finishing ahead of other pre-race favorites like  Alejandro Valverde and  Luis León Sánchez. His main attack came in the mountaintop finish to Mende, where he crossed the finish line alone and successfully secured the yellow jersey. Contador also competed in and concluded the Criterium International with a second place in the final time trial, only 2 seconds behind stage winner  David Millar, while  Pierrick Fédrigo successfully defended the maillot jaune against rivals such as  Cadel Evans and  Samuel Sánchez.
Contador was a favorite coming into the  2010 Tour de France, along with Team Saxo Bank's  Andy Schleck. On Stage 15 Schleck was race leader and pressing the pace over the day's final climb of Port de Bales when he threw his  chain. Contador and Denis Menchov immediately moved to the front and attacked, pressing the advantage over the crest of the climb and all the way back down into Bagneres-de-Luchon. They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow Jersey and 39 seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium at the end of the stage. It is an unusual occurrence in the Tour for the new race leader to be met with whistles and cat calls as he is given the yellow jersey. The yellow jersey changing shoulders made a large difference in the remainder of the race, for now the onus was on Schleck to attack Contador, and not the other way around.
Jered Gruber, writing for Velo Nation, argued that Contador was right to attack, defending him on the basis that Schleck did not wait for Contador when he was delayed behind a crash on the cobblestones in stage 3 and lost 1' 13&quot; to Schleck, a crash that cost Schleck the aid of his best ally in the tour, his brother  Fränk Schleck. But of course that was early in the race and neither rider had the yellow jersey at the time. Race commentator Paul Sherwen thought the attack in poor form, whereas his co-commentor Phil Liggett thought not. Schleck said he considered Contador's actions to be unsporting. Hours after the conclusion of the stage, Contador voiced an apology for his behaviour on his YouTube channel. Five days later in the stage 19 time trial, Contador beat Schleck again, taking 31 seconds from him. Contador went on to win the Tour de France for the third time with an advantage of 39 seconds over Andy Schleck, the exact amount of time he had taken from Schleck on Stage 15. Contador became the seventh rider to win a Tour de France without winning a stage.
Contador has signed a two-year contract with  Saxo Bank-SunGard for the 2011 season, to ride under team manager  Bjarne Riis, who revealed that he would like Contador to try winning all three  Grand Tours in one season, a feat never before accomplished. Contador's agent and brother Fran later countered the statement by saying it was &quot;nothing but a dream&quot;. Within two weeks, three of Contador's Spanish teammates signed to make the same transfer:  Jesús Hernández,  Daniel Navarro and  Benjamín Noval.
Amidst the clenbuterol controversy, Contador earned his first win in the Vuelta a Murcia. He won the overall classification as well as two stage victories en route to his victory. Later in the month of March, Contador entered in the  Volta a Catalunya, where he claimed a win on the third stage to  Vallnord, maintaining his advantage until the end of the race. He also won the individual time trial of  Vuelta a Castilla y León.
Contador competed in the  2011 Giro d'Italia, his first time racing in the Giro since his victory in  2008. Contador won the  ninth stage on  Mount Etna, his first stage win at the Italian Grand Tour. That stage gave him the overall lead in the Giro, as well as the points classification. He also won the 12.7 km (7.9 mi) mountain time-trial to Nevegal. On 29 May, Contador went on to win the  race for the second time. In addition to winning the General Classification, Contador also won the Points Classification and finished second in the Mountains classification.
Despite the fact that he was scheduled to appear before the  Court of Arbitration for Sport in early August, Contador announced in early June he would compete in the  2011 Tour de France. The CAS had planned to hear the case in early June but the dates were pushed back to early August. Contador aimed to become the first rider to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France in the same year since  Marco Pantani accomplished the feat in 1998.
In the opening stage Contador got slowed down by a crash and lost more than one minute. He lost additional time in the  team time trial at  Les Essarts but finished second in the fourth stage up to  Mûr-de-Bretagne. Contador suffered four crashes in the opening nine days of the Tour, injuring his right knee before facing the Pyrenees mountain stages. He was dropped in the final kilometer in the stage to  Luz Ardiden and finished two seconds behind  Andy Schleck at the top of the  Plateau de Beille. On the sixteenth stage to  Gap, Contador attacked on the ascent of the Col de Manse, with  Cadel Evans and  Samuel Sánchez joining him in taking a time advantage over the other favorites in the general classification, including more than a minute over Andy Schleck. He was also aggressive in the next stage to  Pinerolo but unable to win time to the other favorites besides  Thomas Voeckler and  Ivan Basso. In the stage to  Col du Galibier he lost time to the other favorites after Andy Schleck launched a solo attack sixty kilometers from the finish and Contador was later unable to follow the pace set by Cadel Evans. Contador launched an early attack on the last mountain stage to  Alpe d'Huez, reaching the top of Galibier with Andy Schleck, but their effort proved unsuccessful and they were captured by the rest of the main contenders following the long descent from the mountain. Contador launched another attack on the first kilometers of Alpe d'Huez but he was eventually beaten to victory by  Pierre Rolland with  Samuel Sánchez second. Contador finished fifth in the overall classification, 3 minutes 57 seconds behind  Cadel Evans, bringing an end to his streak of six consecutive  Grand Tour victories.
Contador started his season with still no verdict in the clenbuterol case. He finished second overall in the  Tour de San Luis and he won both uphill finishes. He only fell short in the time trial stage of the race. On 6 February he was stripped of these early results, as well the  2010 Tour de France and  2011 Giro d'Italia wins and many other victories. He was also suspended until 5 August 2012 and his contract with  Team Saxo Bank was annulled.
On 8 June it was announced that Contador would rejoin Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank upon the completion of his ban, signing a contract that will keep him with the team until the end of the 2015 season. After the completion of his suspension, Contador competed in the  2012 Eneco Tour as preparation for the  Vuelta a España where he finished 4th in the general classification. Consequently, Contador was named leader of Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank for the  Vuelta a España. Contador attacked numerous times throughout the mountains in the first sixteen stages of the race, but with no avail, since the race leader  Joaquim Rodríguez always countered and finished ahead of him. This proved costly since there were bonus seconds awarded to the first three riders of each stage: twelve seconds for first, eight seconds for second and four seconds for third. Even on the  queen stage of the race, finishing atop the  Cuitu Negru and featuring slopes with a gradient of more than 20% close to the line, Rodriguez annulled the numerous attacks of Contador and sailed past him to the finish. However, his fortunes turned around during the  seventeenth stage; he attacked in that latter portion of the stage and made a solo effort up the final climb of the day after his breakaway companion  Paolo Tiralongo of  Astana was dropped. Contador won the stage by six seconds over the first chase group and took the lead away from Joaquim Rodríguez, who was relegated to more than two minutes in the general classification. He held on to the race lead during  the last mountain stage leading atop the Bola del Mondo, where he was dropped by Rodriguez and  Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team), who held the second place overall. He managed to limit his losses and retain the lead of the race. On the next day, Contador crossed the finish line in Madrid with the race leader's red jersey, earned the second Vuelta victory of his career.
Contador participated to the  World Championships held in  Valkenburg in both the road race and the time trial. He took the ninth place in the individual effort, after being overtaken by eventual winner  Tony Martin, who started two minutes behind him. For the road race, Contador rode in support of his Spaniard teammates and finished 53 seconds in arrears of the victor, Belgian  Philippe Gilbert. Days later, Contador headed for Italy to take part in the newly resurrected Classic  Milano–Torino. He took the win by accelerating on the final slope of the day in sight of the 'one kilometer' banner, dropping all contenders. It was the first time in his career that he won a single-day race, and he dedicated the event to the memory of  Victor Cabedo, a young professional cyclist who died in a training accident a week prior.
After final rosters had been presented for the 2006 Tour de France, Contador and five other members of the Astana-Würth team were barred from competing due to alleged connections with the  Operación Puerto doping case. Contador and four other members of his team at the time,  Astana-Würth, were eventually cleared of all charges on 26 July 2006 by the Spanish courts and later two out of the five (including Contador) were cleared by the UCI. Each received a written document signed by Manuel Sánchez Martín, secretary for the Spanish court, stating that &quot;there are not any type of charges against them nor have there been adopted any type of legal action against them.&quot;
In May 2006, a document from the summary of the investigation (Documento 31) was released. In it, Contador's initials (A.C.) were associated with a hand-written note saying, &quot;Nada o igual a J.J.&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Nothing or like J.J.&quot;). J.J. were the initials of  Jörg Jaksche, who later admitted to being guilty of  blood doping prepared by the Spanish doctor  Eufemiano Fuentes in 2005. Contador was questioned in December 2006 by the magistrate in charge of the Puerto file. The rider declared to Judge Antonio Serrano that he did not know Eufemiano Fuentes personally. According to French daily  Le Monde, he refused then to undergo a  DNA test that would have judged whether or not he had any link to the blood bags that were found in the investigation.
On 28 July 2007, Le Monde, citing what it claimed was an investigation file to which it had access, stated that Contador's name appeared in several documents found during Operación Puerto. A second reference includes initials of riders’ names that appeared on another training document, although neither of those two references could be linked to doping practices.
On 30 July 2007, German doping expert  Werner Franke accused Contador of having taken drugs in the past and being prescribed a doping regimen by Fuentes, who was connected with Operación Puerto. He passed his allegations on to the German authorities on 31 July 2007. Contador denied the accusations, saying &quot;I was in the wrong team at the wrong time and somehow my name got among the documents.&quot; On 10 August, Contador publicly declared himself to be a clean rider in face of suspicions about his alleged links to the Operación Puerto blood doping ring.
During the  2009 Tour de France, former Tour champion Greg LeMond wrote a column for  Le Monde in which he noted that Contador's time up  Verbier was the fastest climb in the history of the Tour, which LeMond claimed would require a level of oxygen transport ( VO2) &quot;that has never been achieved by any athlete in any sport,&quot; and demanded that Contador prove that he was capable of that level of aerobic ability &quot;without falling back to the use of performance enhancing products.&quot; At a press conference later that day, Contador refused to answer questions about the article. Subsequently, other experts disagreed with the calculations in LeMond's article, which were done by French physiology professor Antoine Vayer, who was a trainer for the  Festina cycling team until the  Festina affair in 1998. Two physiologists claimed Vayer's assumptions overstate the needed level of oxygen transport, and that the level Contador needed, while &quot;still quite high,&quot; is &quot;not so high that you can definitively state that it can only be achieved via doping.&quot; A third, who noted that Vayer is the leading expert in this field and &quot;more than anyone, knows how to look at a climb in context&quot;, nevertheless also questioned Vayer's assumptions.
In September 2010, Contador revealed that a urine sample he had given on 21 July, a rest day in the  2010 Tour de France, had contained traces of  clenbuterol. He has stated, due to the number of other tests he passed and that only a tiny amount of the substance was detected in the one he failed, that food contamination was to blame. Adding credibility to the explanation, anti-doping doctor  Don Catlin said that of the contaminants found in food supplements, clenbuterol is one of the more common. However, when asked if it was plausible that Contador had ingested the clenbuterol through contamination, Catlin said &quot;without knowing what the level in his sample is, it's impossible to say.&quot; Contador stated that he is the victim, and he can &quot;hold his head high&quot; and that he thinks he should not be punished. Several people related to the sport defended Contador saying that there is little benefit from using the drug in the amounts that were discovered and that no one would intentionally take such an easily detectable substance.
There has been some scepticism of Contador's claim that contaminated meat was to blame. In 2008 and 2009, only one animal sample came back positive for clenbuterol out of 83,203 animal samples tested by EU member nations. Out of 19,431 animal tests in Spain over the same period, there were no samples that came back positive for clenbuterol. Contador's urine sample, taken during the day before his clenbuterol positive sample, was reported to contain plastic residue indicating possible  blood doping, but the test is not recognised by the  World Anti-Doping Agency, so no charges in relation to this finding were brought. A theory has circulated that blood doping could account for the minute traces if the clenbuterol was introduced through a transfusion of already contaminated blood, rather than ingestion or injection.
The UCI issued a statement reporting that the concentration was 50  picograms per millilitre, and that this was 400 times below the minimum standards of detection capability required by  WADA, and that further scientific investigation would be required. Contador was provisionally suspended from competition, although this had no short-term effect as he had already finished his racing programme for the 2010 season. Contador had been informed of the results over a month earlier, on 24 August. Later the amount discovered was clarified as 40 times below the minimum standards, rather than the 400 times originally reported by the UCI. Contador's scientific adviser claimed that he would have needed 180 times the amount detected to gain any benefit in his performance.
In late January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation ( RFEC) proposed a one-year ban, but it subsequently accepted Contador's appeal and cleared him of all charges. Contador returned to racing in February in the  Volta ao Algarve, a race he won in 2009 and 2010. The UCI and the  World Anti-Doping Agency each appealed the RFEC decision independently to the  Court of Arbitration for Sport in March 2011, but Contador remained free to ride until the CAS made its ruling. The hearing with CAS was initially scheduled for June, but following an extension requested by Contador's legal team, it was rearranged for August, in the week following the  2011 Tour de France, and later postponed again until November 2011, with the result to be given in 2012. The decision on 6 February 2012 was that Contador lost his 2010 Tour de France title, and his results since that race, including victory in the  2011 Giro d'Italia and fifth place in the  2011 Tour de France, were voided, and he was suspended until August 2012. The following day, in a press conference, his contract with Team Saxo Bank was annulled.
